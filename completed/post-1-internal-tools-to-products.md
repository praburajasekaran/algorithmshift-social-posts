🔀 **Your internal tool just became a real product. Now what? Retool, Bubble, or AlgorithmShift?**

Here's a scenario every tech leader faces: You built an internal dashboard or tool that's working great. Now stakeholders want to turn it into a customer-facing product, add native mobile, or integrate AI agents.

**The platform you chose matters more than you think.**

**The Decision Matrix:**

📊 **Retool:**
- ✅ Excellent for internal dashboards
- ❌ No native mobile apps
- ❌ Limited public-facing UX
- ❌ Stays internal-only

📊 **Bubble:**
- ✅ Good for public web apps
- ❌ No code export (vendor lock-in)
- ❌ No native mobile
- ❌ Performance ceilings at scale

📊 **AlgorithmShift:**
- ✅ Web apps (React/Next.js)
- ✅ Native mobile (React Native)
- ✅ AI agents with RAG & tools
- ✅ Visual workflows
- ✅ Full code access (no lock-in)
- ✅ SOC2-ready for enterprise

**The strategic question:**

When your internal tool needs to become a real product, you need a platform that can scale with you — not one that boxes you in.

**Key considerations:**
- Will you need native mobile? (Retool: No. Bubble: No. AlgorithmShift: Yes.)
- Will you need AI agents? (Retool: Limited. Bubble: Limited. AlgorithmShift: Built-in.)
- Will you need full code control? (Retool: Partial. Bubble: No. AlgorithmShift: Yes.)
- Will you need enterprise compliance? (Retool: Basic. Bubble: Basic. AlgorithmShift: SOC2-ready.)

**The reality:**

Most teams start with internal tools, then realize they need to ship real products. Choosing a platform that can't grow with you means rebuilding everything later — at 10x the cost.

At AlgorithmShift, we built our platform for this exact journey: Start with visual builders, scale to full-stack products, export to real code when you need it.

Your internal tool just became a real product. 🚀

Now what?

**RETOOL:**
✓ Great for dashboards
✗ No native mobile
✗ Stays internal

**BUBBLE:**
✓ Public web apps
✗ No code export
✗ No mobile
✗ Locked in

**ALGORITHMSHIFT:**
✓ Web apps
✓ Native mobile
✓ AI agents
✓ Full code access
✓ No lock-in

**The question isn't:**
"What tool should I use?"

**The question is:**
"What will I need in 6 months?" 💭

When your internal tool needs to become a REAL product, you need a platform that can grow with you.

Not one that boxes you in.

**Think about it:**
- Need native mobile? → AlgorithmShift
- Need AI agents? → AlgorithmShift
- Need full control? → AlgorithmShift
- Need to scale? → AlgorithmShift

**The reality:**
Most teams start internal.
Then they need to ship.
Then they realize their platform can't keep up.

Don't rebuild at 10x the cost.
Choose a platform that scales. 💪

💡 **Here's a situation every tech team faces: Your internal tool is working great, and now you need to turn it into a real product.**

Maybe you need to add native mobile. Or integrate AI agents. Or make it customer-facing. Suddenly, the platform you chose matters a lot more.

**The Platform Comparison:**

**Retool:**
- Great for internal dashboards
- But: No native mobile apps
- But: Limited public-facing options
- Best for: Teams that stay internal-only

**Bubble:**
- Good for public web applications
- But: No code export (you're locked in)
- But: No native mobile apps
- But: Performance limits at scale
- Best for: Simple web apps you'll never need to customize deeply

**AlgorithmShift:**
- Web apps (React/Next.js)
- Native mobile apps (React Native)
- AI agents with RAG & tools
- Visual workflow automation
- Full code access (no vendor lock-in)
- SOC2-ready for enterprise
- Best for: Teams that need to scale and evolve

**The key question:**

What will you need in 6 months? In a year? If you might need mobile, AI, or full code control, choose a platform that can grow with you.

**The cost of choosing wrong:**

Rebuilding your entire product on a new platform later can cost 10x more than choosing the right platform from the start.

**Think about it:**

If you're building something that might become a real product, don't box yourself in with a platform that can't scale.

At AlgorithmShift, we built our platform for exactly this journey — from internal tools to full-stack products, with the flexibility to export to real code when you need it.

Curious which platform is right for your product journey?
