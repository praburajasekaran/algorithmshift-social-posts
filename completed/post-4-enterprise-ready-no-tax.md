💰 **Enterprise security and compliance shouldn't cost 7 figures. Here's how to get SOC2-ready infrastructure without the enterprise tax.**

Most enterprise platforms charge premium prices for features that should be standard:
- Custom SSO integration: $50K+ setup
- Security compliance: $200K+ consulting
- Dedicated support: $100K+ annual retainer
- Complex licensing: $500K+ per year

**The Legacy Enterprise Stack:**
- 7-figure contracts
- Months-long deployment
- Custom SSO vendor integration
- Heavy maintenance overhead
- Limited agility
- Complex licensing models

**The AlgorithmShift Platform:**
- SOC2 track (working towards compliance)
- SAML & OAuth built-in
- Row-Level Security (RLS) at database level
- 24/7 dedicated support
- Predictable pricing (1/10th the cost)
- Deploy in weeks, not months

**Enterprise Features, Startup Agility:**

✅ **Built-in Authentication:**
- SAML SSO for enterprise
- OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft, GitHub)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Row-level security (RLS) policies

✅ **Security & Compliance:**
- Working towards SOC2 Type II
- ISO 27001 compliance track
- GDPR and PIPEDA ready
- Audit-ready logging
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

✅ **Enterprise Support:**
- 24/7 dedicated support
- SLA guarantees
- Priority response times
- Enterprise onboarding

✅ **Predictable Pricing:**
- No hidden enterprise tax
- Transparent pricing model
- Scale as you grow
- 1/10th the cost of legacy platforms

**The Strategic Question:**

Do you need enterprise-grade security and compliance, or do you need to pay enterprise prices for it?

**The reality:**

You can have both. Enterprise-ready infrastructure doesn't have to come with enterprise pricing.

**Real-world comparison:**

Legacy Enterprise Platform:
- Setup: $200K
- Annual licensing: $500K
- Custom integrations: $100K
- Support retainer: $100K
- **Total Year 1: $900K**

AlgorithmShift Platform:
- Setup: Included
- Annual platform: $50K
- Integrations: Built-in
- Support: Included
- **Total Year 1: $50K**

**That's 1/10th the cost for the same capabilities.**

At AlgorithmShift, we're proving that enterprise-grade doesn't have to mean enterprise-priced. You get SOC2-ready infrastructure, built-in SSO, dedicated support, and predictable pricing — without the 7-figure contracts.

💡 **Here's a question for business owners and IT leaders: Why does "enterprise-grade" have to mean "enterprise-priced"?**

Most enterprise platforms charge premium prices for features that should be standard:
- Custom SSO integration: $50K+ setup fees
- Security compliance: $200K+ in consulting
- Dedicated support: $100K+ annual retainers
- Complex licensing: $500K+ per year

**The Legacy Enterprise Approach:**
- 7-figure contracts
- Months-long deployment cycles
- Separate vendors for SSO, security, support
- Fragmented tooling
- Complex licensing models

**The AlgorithmShift Approach:**
- SOC2-ready infrastructure (working towards compliance)
- SAML & OAuth built-in (no custom integration needed)
- Row-Level Security at the database level
- 24/7 dedicated support included
- Predictable, transparent pricing
- Deploy in weeks, not months

**Enterprise Features, Startup Pricing:**

✅ SOC2, ISO, GDPR compliance track
✅ SAML/OAuth/RLS baked into the platform
✅ Dedicated support + SLA guarantees
✅ Predictable pricing (1/10th the cost)

**The Cost Comparison:**

Legacy Enterprise Platform:
- Year 1: ~$900K (setup, licensing, integrations, support)

AlgorithmShift Platform:
- Year 1: ~$50K (everything included)

**That's $850K saved in the first year alone.**

**The question isn't:**
"Do we need enterprise security and compliance?"

**The question is:**
"Do we need to pay enterprise prices for it?"

At AlgorithmShift, we're proving you can have both: Enterprise-ready infrastructure without the enterprise tax.

Curious how much you could save with enterprise-grade at startup pricing?
