This guide will walk you through creating your first application.What You'll BuildIn this quick start, you'll create a simple task management application with:✓ Database tables for storing tasks✓ Auto-generated REST APIs✓ Visual app builder interface✓ User authentication✓ Deployed to productionPrerequisitesBefore you begin, make sure you have:AlgorithmShift AccountSign up at algorithmshift.aiWeb BrowserChrome, Firefox, or SafariStep 1: Create a WorkspaceA workspace is your isolated development environment. Each workspace has its own database, APIs, and team members.1Navigate to the DashboardAfter logging in, you'll be prompted to create your first workspace.Copy// Your workspace will be automatically provisioned with:
- PostgreSQL database (isolated schema)
- REST API endpoints
- GraphQL API
- Authentication system
- Storage bucket (AWS S3)2Enter Workspace DetailsProvide a name and slug for your workspace.Workspace NameMy CompanyWorkspace Slugmy-company (used in URLs)3Workspace Created!Your workspace is now ready. You'll automatically be assigned as the workspace_admin.Step 2: Create a Database TableLet's create a table to store our tasks. AlgorithmShift will automatically generate REST APIs for this table.Using the Visual Schema Designer1. Navigate to Data Management → Tables2. Click "Create Table"3. Name it tasks4. Add the following columns:Column NameTypeConstraintsidUUIDPrimary KeytitleVARCHAR(255)NOT NULLdescriptionTEXT-statusVARCHAR(50)Default: 'pending'created_atTIMESTAMPDefault: NOW()Auto-Generated APIsWhen you create a table, AlgorithmShift automatically generates REST APIs:CopyGET
/api/v1/tables/tasks
# List all tasks
POST
/api/v1/tables/tasks
# Create a task
GET
/api/v1/tables/tasks/:id
# Get single task
PUT
/api/v1/tables/tasks/:id
# Update a task
DELETE /api/v1/tables/tasks/:id
# Delete a taskStep 3: Test Your APILet's test the auto-generated API by creating a task.Using cURLCopycurl -X POST \
https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1/tables/tasks \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"title": "My First Task",
"description": "Testing the API",
"status": "pending"
}'Using JavaScriptCopyconst response = await fetch(
'https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1/tables/tasks',
{
method: 'POST',
headers: {
'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
'Content-Type': 'application/json'
},
body: JSON.stringify({
title: 'My First Task',
description: 'Testing the API',
status: 'pending'
})
}
);
const task = await response.json();API ResponseCopy{
"success": true,
"data": {
"id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
"title": "My First Task",
"description": "Testing the API",
"status": "pending",
"created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
}Step 4: Build the User InterfaceNow let's create a visual interface for our task management app using the drag-and-drop builder.Create Your First App1. Navigate to App Builder → Apps2. Click "Create App"3. Choose "Web App" or "Mobile App"4. Name it "Task Manager"5. Click "Open Builder"+Add Components to Your PageDrag and drop components from the left sidebar onto the canvas:ContainerLayout wrapperTableDisplay tasksFormAdd new tasksButtonActionsConnect to Your DataBind the Table component to your tasks table:1. Select the Table component2. In the properties panel, set Data Source to "tasks"3. The table will automatically display your tasksStep 5: Add AuthenticationProtect your app with built-in authentication.Copy// Enable authentication in your app settings
{
"authentication": {
"required": true,
"providers": ["email", "google"],
"redirectUrl": "/dashboard"
}
}Row-Level Security (RLS)For multi-user apps, enable RLS on your tasks table so users can only see their own tasks. Learn more in the RLS documentation.Step 6: Deploy Your AppDeploy your app to production with a single click.Instant DeployClick "Deploy" button in the app builderAuto ScalingYour app automatically scales with trafficLive URLGet a production URL instantlyCopy# Your app is now live at:

Learn why the smartest businesses are making the switch to platforms that give them true ownership.SShankar PrabhuNovember 23, 202512 min readShare:The $300K Trap: Why Smart Companies Are Ditching Traditional CRMs in 2025
Introduction: The Wake-Up Call
Last month, I spoke with the CTO of a mid-sized logistics company. They'd been using Salesforce for three years, spending roughly $15,000 per month—$180,000 total. When their vendor announced a 40% price increase, they decided to explore alternatives.
That's when they discovered the trap.
After three years and nearly $200,000 invested in customizations, workflows, and business logic, they couldn't export any of it. Their entire sales process, customer relationships, and operational workflows were locked in a proprietary system they didn't own.
They had two choices: pay the ransom or start over.
This story isn't unique. It's happening to thousands of companies right now. And it's exactly why 2025 is becoming the year of the great CRM exodus.
The Three Traps That Cost Companies Everything
💸 Trap #1: The Cost Trap
Let's talk about real numbers. Here's what a traditional CRM actually costs for a 20-person team over 5 years:
Salesforce Sales Cloud + AI:
Base License: $150/user × 20 × 12 months × 5 years = $180,000
AI Features (Agentforce): $50/user × 20 × 12 months × 5 years = $60,000
SSO/SAML: $5,000/year × 5 years = $25,000
Extra Storage: $2,000/year × 5 years = $10,000
API Limit Overages: $3,000/year × 5 years = $15,000
Implementation & Training: $40,000 (one-time)
Total: $330,000+
HubSpot Enterprise Stack:
Sales Hub Professional: $1,600/month × 60 months = $96,000
Marketing Hub Professional: $1,000/month × 60 months = $60,000
Service Hub Professional: $1,000/month × 60 months = $60,000
Breeze AI agents: $800/month × 60 months = $48,000
Total: $264,000+
Microsoft Dynamics 365:
Sales Professional: $120/user × 20 × 12 × 5 = $144,000
Copilot Studio: $50/user × 20 × 12 × 5 = $60,000
Implementation: $25,000
Total: $229,000+
And these are conservative estimates. Many companies end up spending 30-50% more due to:
Premium support contracts
Additional user licenses as they grow
Third-party integrations and plugins
Consultant fees for customizations
Training and certification programs
🔒 Trap #2: The Coding Trap
Here's where the "no-code" marketing falls apart.
Traditional CRM vendors market themselves as "no-code" or "low-code" platforms. But the moment you need real customization—which is almost immediately—you discover the truth:
Salesforce requires Apex, a proprietary Java-like language:
6-12 month learning curve for experienced developers
Limited talent pool (specialized Salesforce developers command $150K+/year)
Skills are completely wasted if you ever leave the platform
Requires additional learning: SOQL (proprietary SQL), Lightning Web Components, Visualforce
Microsoft Dynamics requires C# plugins and Power Apps:
3-6 month learning curve
Power Fx (proprietary formula language)
Complex, expensive licensing for development tools
Heavy Microsoft ecosystem lock-in
HubSpot offers very limited customization:
Basic workflows only
Custom properties but no real data modeling
Forced into HubSpot's way of doing things
Any serious customization requires expensive agency help
The irony is brutal: You chose a CRM to avoid hiring developers, but end up needing specialized developers who cost even more.
⛓️ Trap #3: The Ownership Trap (The Biggest One)
This is the trap that companies don't realize they're in until it's too late.
After spending $300K over 5 years, you own:
❌ Zero source code
❌ Zero exportable business logic
❌ Zero intellectual property
❌ Zero leverage
What you do have:
✅ Data (contacts, deals) in the vendor's format
✅ A monthly bill that keeps increasing
✅ Complete dependence on the vendor
The Real-World Impact
Let me share what this looks like in practice:
Scenario 1: The Price Increase
Your CRM vendor raises prices 40%. You can't negotiate because they know you can't leave. Migration would cost $75K+ and take 12-18 months. You're held hostage.
Scenario 2: The Feature You Need
Your business has a unique workflow that's core to your competitive advantage. Your CRM can't support it without extensive (read: expensive) custom development. You either compromise your business process or pay a consultant $200/hour to build it in a proprietary language you don't control.
Scenario 3: The Acquisition
Your CRM vendor gets acquired. The new owner changes the product direction, discontinues features you rely on, or doubles the price. You have no recourse.
Scenario 4: The Scale Problem
You grow from 20 to 200 employees. Your CRM bill goes from $4,000/month to $40,000/month—even though your actual infrastructure costs barely increased. Per-user pricing is a tax on success.
Why 2025 Is Different: The Perfect Storm
Several forces have converged to make 2025 the inflection point:
1. AI Has Democratized Development
Before 2024: Building custom software required months of developer time
Now: AI can generate production-ready code from natural language descriptions
This fundamentally changes the build vs. buy equation. Building custom software is suddenly 10x faster and cheaper.
2. React Has Become Universal
There are 13+ million React developers worldwide. React isn't just popular—it's the standard. This means:
Massive talent pool (easy and affordable to hire)
Huge ecosystem of components and tools
No vendor lock-in—React skills transfer everywhere
Compare this to:
Salesforce Apex developers: Maybe 100,000 globally
Microsoft Dynamics C# specialists: Limited pool
Both command premium salaries due to scarcity
3. Vendor Lock-In Fatigue Has Reached Critical Mass
The horror stories are piling up:
40% price increases with no notice
Essential features moved to higher tiers
Arbitrary API limits causing outages
Forced migration to new platforms (remember Salesforce Classic → Lightning?)
Companies are fed up. The Twitter/X threads about CRM horror stories go viral weekly.
4. Mobile-First Is No Longer Optional
60% of enterprise applications now need mobile versions. Traditional CRMs offer:
Mobile-responsive web views (slow, poor UX)
Wrapped web apps (still poor performance)
Expensive native app development (if they offer it at all)
Modern businesses need real native mobile apps. CRMs can't deliver.
5. The Economics Have Flipped
Old Math:
Build custom: $200K+ in developer time
Buy CRM: $50K/year (seems cheaper!)
New Math:
Build custom on modern platform: $10-20K in time
Buy CRM: Still $50K/year
Build is now 60-80% cheaper
The Alternative: What's Different Now?
The solution isn't to buy a different CRM. It's to stop renting software and start owning it.
Here's what the new approach looks like:
1. Build Exactly What You Need
Instead of forcing your business into Salesforce's data model, design your application around your actual workflow.
Example: Property Management Company
Traditional CRM approach:
Try to map "Properties" to "Accounts"
Map "Tenants" to "Contacts"
Map "Maintenance Requests" to "Cases"
Fight with the system constantly because it's not designed for property management
Custom platform approach:
Create a "Properties" table with fields that matter to you
Create a "Tenants" table with lease information, payment history, etc.
Create a "Maintenance" table with request types, photos, assignments
Build exactly the workflow your team needs
2. Use Modern Tools That Give You Speed AND Control
The best modern platforms offer three ways to build:
Visual Builder: For speed
Drag-and-drop interface
60+ pre-built components
No coding required for 80% of features
Build in days, not months
AI Prompt-to-Code: For complexity
Describe what you want in plain English
AI generates the code
Review, test, deploy
Handle advanced features in minutes
Standard Code Access: For ultimate control
React, TypeScript, Node.js (standard technologies)
Export your source code anytime
Hire from a pool of millions of developers
Never locked in
3. Own Your Source Code
This is the game-changer. Imagine if:
You could export your entire CRM as React/TypeScript source code
You could run it on AWS, Azure, or your own servers
You could hire any React developer to maintain it
The platform shut down tomorrow, and you'd still have working applications
That's not hypothetical. That's what true ownership looks like.
Real-World Example: The UrbanHomes Story
Let me share a real example (details slightly changed for privacy):
UrbanHomes Property Management
Managing 500+ rental properties
15-person team
Tech-savvy but not developers
Their Salesforce Experience:
$4,000/month ($48,000/year)
Couldn't properly model properties, units, leases
Mobile app was basically unusable for maintenance staff
Every customization required expensive consultants
Total 3-year cost: $160,000+
Their Switch to AlgorithmShift:
Built custom property management system in 4 weeks
Features:
Tenant self-service portal
Native mobile app for maintenance team (works offline!)
Automated rent reminders and maintenance routing
Custom dashboard with occupancy, financials, maintenance status
Cost: $299/month ($3,588/year)
5-year savings: $220,000+
The Best Part:
They own the source code. If they ever want to:
Self-host on AWS
Hire a developer to add features
Migrate to a different platform
They can. No permission needed. No ransom payment. No starting over.
The Decision Framework: When to Stay vs. When to Leave
Not every company should abandon their CRM tomorrow. Here's how to decide:
Stay with Traditional CRM If:
❓ You use only basic features (contact management, deal tracking)
❓ You have zero technical resources and can't hire any
❓ You're in a highly regulated industry requiring specific CRM certifications (rare)
❓ Your CRM is so deeply integrated it would take >18 months to migrate (but start planning now)
Consider the Switch If:
✅ You're customizing heavily (Apex code, complex workflows)
✅ You're spending $30K+/year on your CRM
✅ You need mobile apps for field teams
✅ You need features your CRM doesn't support
✅ Your CRM bill keeps increasing
✅ You have (or can hire) at least one technical person
✅ You're building multiple applications (CRM + portal + internal tools)
✅ You value ownership and flexibility
10 Questions to Ask Before Renewing Your CRM Contract
Before you sign that renewal, ask your vendor:
Can I export my source code and business logic?
(Hint: The answer is no)
What happens if you increase prices by 40% next year?
(Hint: You pay or lose everything)
Can I self-host this on my own infrastructure?
(Hint: Not without enterprise mega-contracts)
Who owns the customizations my team builds?
(Hint: They do, not you)
Can I hire any developer to maintain this, or do I need specialists?
(Hint: You need expensive specialists)
What does it cost to migrate away from your platform?
(Hint: $50K-100K+ and 12-18 months)
Do your mobile apps have feature parity with the web?
(Hint: No, they're web wrappers)
Can I use any AI model I want, or am I locked to yours?
(Hint: Locked to theirs)
What happens if you get acquired or change direction?
(Hint: You're screwed)
If I spend $300K over 5 years, what do I own at the end?
(Hint: Nothing)
If these answers bother you, you're in the trap.
The Path Forward
The future of business software isn't buying CRMs with AI features bolted on. It's building exactly what your business needs on platforms that give you:
✅ Speed (visual tools + AI)
✅ Power (full code access when needed)
✅ Ownership (export anytime)
✅ Flexibility (any use case, not just CRM)
✅ Affordability (per-workspace, not per-user)
Companies that make this shift are:
Saving $200K+ over 5 years
Building better applications faster
Owning their intellectual property
Never worrying about vendor lock-in again
Conclusion: The $300K Question
Here's the question every company needs to ask:
"If we spend $300K over 5 years, shouldn't we own something at the end?"
Traditional CRMs say: "No, you rent forever."
The new generation of platforms says: "Yes, here's your source code."
The choice is yours. But remember: Every month you stay in the trap is another month of rent you'll never get back.

Introduction: A Different Kind of Tutorial
When companies tell me they need a CRM, I ask them: "Do you need a CRM, or do you need software that manages your customer relationships the way YOUR business works?"
There's a huge difference.
Traditional CRMs force you into their model. Salesforce wants you to use Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, and Cases—regardless of whether that matches your business. HubSpot gives you Marketing, Sales, and Service Hubs with rigid workflows.
What if you could build exactly what you need? Not in 6-12 months with a six-figure budget, but in one week?
This guide will show you how.
What You'll Build
By the end of this week, you'll have:
✅ Custom Database Schema
Companies, Contacts, Deals, Activities tables
Relationships and validation rules
Full SQL access for advanced queries
✅ Web Application
Contact management with search and filters
Deal pipeline with drag-and-drop Kanban board
Activity timeline and notes
Analytics dashboard with charts
Responsive design (works on all devices)
✅ Native Mobile Apps
iOS and Android from the same codebase
Offline mode for field sales reps
Push notifications for deal updates
Camera integration for business card scanning
✅ Workflow Automation
Email automation when deal stages change
Auto-assign deals based on territory or criteria
Weekly digest emails
Slack/Teams notifications
✅ AI-Powered Features
Chatbot that answers questions about contacts and deals
Email draft generation
Meeting summary creation
Data entry assistance
✅ Security & Permissions
Row-level security (sales reps see only their deals)
Role-based access control
OAuth/SAML SSO integration
Audit logging
Most Importantly: You'll own the complete React/TypeScript source code. Export it anytime, run it anywhere, hire any developer to maintain it.
Prerequisites
What you'll need:
A free AlgorithmShift account (sign up at algorithmshift.ai)
Basic understanding of databases (what's a table, field, relationship)
Optional: React/TypeScript knowledge for advanced customization
What you DON'T need:
Coding experience (visual builder handles 80% of the work)
A development team
Months of time
Thousands of dollars
Time commitment:
~3-5 hours per day
Spread across 5-7 days
Flexible schedule (work at your own pace)
Let's begin.
Day 1: Database Design
Understanding Your Data Model
Before building any interface, you need to design your database. This is the foundation everything else builds on.
A typical CRM has four core entities:
Companies (Organizations you do business with)
Contacts (People at those companies)
Deals (Sales opportunities)
Activities (Calls, meetings, emails, notes)
Step 1: Create Your Companies Table
Open the AlgorithmShift database designer (Visual → Database → Add Table).
Companies table:
Table: companies
Fields:
- id (UUID, primary key, auto-generated)
- name (Text, required, max 200 chars)
- domain (Text, unique) // e.g., "acme.com"
- industry (Select: Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Retail, Other)
- size (Select: 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-1000, 1000+)
- address (Text)
- city (Text)
- state (Text)
- country (Text)
- phone (Phone number format)
- website (URL)
- created_at (Timestamp, auto-set)
- updated_at (Timestamp, auto-update)
- owner_id (Reference to users table)
Why these fields?
domain lets you auto-enrich data from external sources
owner_id implements ownership (important for security later)
Size and industry enable segmentation for reporting
Step 2: Create Your Contacts Table
Contacts table:
Table: contacts
Fields:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- company_id (Reference to companies, on delete: set null)
- first_name (Text, required)
- last_name (Text, required)
- full_name (Computed: first_name + ' ' + last_name)
- email (Email, unique)
- phone (Phone)
- mobile (Phone)
- title (Text) // Job title
- department (Select: Sales, Marketing, Engineering, HR, Other)
- is_primary (Boolean, default: false)
- linkedin_url (URL)
- notes (Long text)
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)
- owner_id (Reference to users)
Relationship:
Many contacts can belong to one company
Foreign key: company_id → companies.id
Step 3: Create Your Deals Table
Deals table:
Table: deals
Fields:
- id (UUID)
- company_id (Reference to companies, required)
- contact_id (Reference to contacts, optional)
- title (Text, required)
- amount (Currency, USD)
- stage (Select: Prospecting, Qualification, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won, Closed Lost)
- probability (Number, 0-100, based on stage)
- expected_close_date (Date)
- actual_close_date (Date)
- source (Select: Website, Referral, Cold Call, Event, Other)
- priority (Select: Low, Medium, High)
- notes (Long text)
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)
- owner_id (Reference to users, required)
Relationship:
Each deal belongs to one company
Each deal optionally has a primary contact
Each deal has an owner (sales rep responsible)
Step 4: Create Your Activities Table
Activities table:
Table: activities
Fields:
- id (UUID)
- type (Select: Call, Email, Meeting, Note, Task)
- subject (Text, required)
- description (Long text)
- due_date (Datetime)
- completed (Boolean, default: false)
- completed_at (Timestamp)
- company_id (Reference to companies)
- contact_id (Reference to contacts)
- deal_id (Reference to deals)
- created_by (Reference to users)
- assigned_to (Reference to users)
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)
Why this design?
Activities can relate to companies, contacts, or deals (flexible)
assigned_to enables task delegation
completed flag for task tracking
Step 5: Add Validation Rules
Set up validation to keep data clean:
Companies:
Name must be unique
Domain format: lowercase, no spaces
Phone format: E.164 international standard
Contacts:
Email must be valid format
At least first_name OR last_name required
Deals:
Amount must be ≥ 0
Expected close date must be in the future
Probability auto-updates based on stage:
Prospecting: 10%
Qualification: 25%
Proposal: 50%
Negotiation: 75%
Closed Won: 100%
Closed Lost: 0%
Step 6: Create Database Indexes
For performance, add indexes on frequently queried fields:
CREATE INDEX idx_companies_owner ON companies(owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_companies_domain ON companies(domain);
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_company ON contacts(company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_email ON contacts(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_deals_company ON deals(company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_deals_stage ON deals(stage);
CREATE INDEX idx_deals_owner ON deals(owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_activities_due_date ON activities(due_date, completed);
Generated automatically by AlgorithmShift's visual designer when you set fields as "indexed."
What You've Accomplished
✅ Complete database schema
✅ Relationships between tables
✅ Validation rules
✅ Performance indexes
✅ Automatic REST and GraphQL APIs for all tables
Auto-generated API endpoints (yes, really):
GET /api/companies - List companies
POST /api/companies - Create company
GET /api/companies/:id - Get one company
PATCH /api/companies/:id - Update company
DELETE /api/companies/:id - Delete company
(Same for contacts, deals, activities)
Day 2: Build the User Interface
Now comes the fun part: building the visual interface. No coding required for this section.
Step 1: Create the Companies List View
Open Visual Builder → Add Page → "Companies"
Drag and drop components:
Page Header
Title: "Companies"
Add button: "+ New Company"
Search & Filter Bar
Search field (searches: name, domain)
Industry filter (dropdown)
Size filter (dropdown)
Owner filter (dropdown)
Data Table Component
Data source: companies table
Columns:
Company Name (link to detail page)
Industry (badge with color coding)
Size
Website (clickable link)
Owner (user avatar + name)
Created (relative date: "2 days ago")
Enable: sorting, pagination (25 per page)
Enable: bulk actions (delete, change owner)
Configuration (no code):
Data Source: companies
Sort: updated_at DESC
Filters: {
industry: filterState.industry,
size: filterState.size,
owner_id: filterState.owner
}
Search: {
fields: ['name', 'domain'],
query: searchState.query
}
Step 2: Create the Company Detail Page
Page layout:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│
← Back to Companies
│
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│
[Company Name]
[Edit]
│

├──────────────────────┤
│
│
Activity Timeline
│
│
│
(Feed)
│
└──────────────┴──────────────────────┘
Left Column: Details Card
Company name
Industry, size, website
Address (formatted)
Phone
Owner (with avatar)
Edit button (opens modal form)
Right Column: Tabs
Tab 1: Contacts (related)
Mini table showing contacts at this company
Columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone
"+ Add Contact" button
Tab 2: Deals (related)
Kanban board showing deals by stage
Or table view toggle
Deal cards show: title, amount, close date
"+ New Deal" button
Tab 3: Activity Timeline
Reverse chronological feed
Icons for each activity type (call, email, meeting)
"Log Activity" button
Step 3: Build the Deal Pipeline (Kanban)
This is the centerpiece of your CRM.
Add Page → "Deals Pipeline"
Drag Kanban Board component:
Data source: deals
Group by: stage
Columns:
- Prospecting
- Qualification
- Proposal
- Negotiation
- Closed Won
- Closed Lost
Card displays:
- Deal title
- Company name
- Amount ($XX,XXX)
- Expected close date
- Owner avatar
- Priority indicator (color)
Enable drag-and-drop between columns
On drop → update deal.stage
Top filters:
Owner filter (dropdown: Me, My Team, All)
Date range (This Month, This Quarter, This Year)
Amount range (slider)
Summary row (above columns):
Column name
Number of deals
Total value
Weighted value (amount × probability)
Step 4: Create Forms
You need forms for creating/editing records.
Company Form:
Fields (left-right, two columns):
Left:
- Company Name*
- Industry*
- Size
- Website
Right:
- Address
- City, State
- Country
- Phone
Validation:
- Name required
- Industry required
- Valid URL for website
- Valid phone format
Actions:
- Save (creates/updates company)
- Cancel (closes modal)
Contact Form, Deal Form: Similar layout.
Pro tip: Forms auto-generate based on your table schema. Just customize the layout.
Step 5: Build the Dashboard
Add Page → "Dashboard"
Grid layout:
┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐

└─────────────┴──────────────────┘
Drag Chart components:
Stat Cards (top row):
Query: SUM(amount) WHERE stage = 'Closed Won' AND month = current
Format as currency
Show trend vs. last month
Revenue by Month (Line Chart):
X-axis: Months
Y-axis: Revenue
Query: SELECT month, SUM(amount) FROM deals WHERE stage = 'Closed Won' GROUP BY month
Deals by Stage (Pie Chart):
Query: SELECT stage, COUNT(*) FROM deals WHERE stage NOT IN ('Closed Won', 'Closed Lost') GROUP BY stage
Top Companies (Table):
Query: SELECT company, SUM(amount) FROM deals GROUP BY company ORDER BY sum DESC LIMIT 10
No SQL? No problem.
The visual query builder lets you construct these queries by clicking. The system generates optimized SQL automatically.
What You've Accomplished
✅ Companies list and detail pages
✅ Deal pipeline Kanban board
✅ Forms for creating/editing data
✅ Analytics dashboard
✅ Responsive design (works on mobile browsers)
All without writing code. The visual builder generated React components behind the scenes.
Day 3: Workflow Automation
Automation is what turns a database into a living CRM.
Step 1: Deal Stage Change Automation
Workflow: "Notify on Deal Stage Change"
Open Workflows → Create New
Trigger: Deal record updated
Condition: deal.stage changed
Actions:
Send Email to Deal Owner
To: {{ deal.owner.email }}
Subject: Deal "{{ deal.title }}" moved to {{ deal.stage }}
Body:
Hi {{ deal.owner.first_name }},
The deal "{{ deal.title }}" with {{ deal.company.name }}
has been moved to {{ deal.stage }}.
Amount: {{ deal.amount | currency }}
Expected close: {{ deal.expected_close_date | date }}
View deal: {{ deal.url }}
Send Slack Notification (if stage = "Closed Won")
Channel: #sales-wins
Message:
🎉 {{ deal.owner.name }} just closed a deal!
Company: {{ deal.company.name }}
Amount: {{ deal.amount | currency }}
Create Activity
Type: Note
Subject: Stage changed to {{ deal.stage }}
Description: Deal moved from {{ deal.previous_stage }} to {{ deal.stage }} by {{ user.name }}
Related to: this deal
Step 2: Auto-Assign Deals Based on Territory
Workflow: "Auto-Assign Deals by Territory"
Trigger: New deal created
Condition: deal.owner_id is empty
Action: Run JavaScript
// Get company state
const state = deal.company.state;
// Territory mapping
const territories = {
'CA': 'user_id_west_rep',
'NY': 'user_id_east_rep',
'TX': 'user_id_south_rep',
// ... more states
};
// Assign owner
deal.owner_id = territories[state] || 'user_id_default_rep';
// Save
await deal.save();
// Send notification to assigned owner
await sendEmail({
to: deal.owner.email,
subject: `New deal assigned: ${deal.title}`,
body: `You've been assigned a new deal in ${state}.`
});
Step 3: Weekly Digest Email
Workflow: "Weekly Sales Digest"
Trigger: Scheduled (every Monday at 9am)
Action: Send Email to All Sales Reps
// Query this week's stats
const stats = await db.query(`
SELECT
owner_id,
COUNT(*) as deals_count,
SUM(amount) as total_value,
COUNT(CASE WHEN stage = 'Closed Won' THEN 1 END) as wins
FROM deals
WHERE updated_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY owner_id
`);
// Send personalized email to each rep
for (const stat of stats) {
await sendEmail({
to: stat.owner.email,
subject: 'Your Weekly Sales Summary',
body: renderTemplate('weekly-digest', {
deals: stat.deals_count,
value: stat.total_value,
wins: stat.wins,
upcoming: stat.closing_soon
})
});
}
Step 4: Deal Reminder Workflow
Workflow: "Deal Close Date Reminders"
Trigger: Scheduled (daily at 8am)
Action:
// Find deals closing in next 7 days
const upcomingDeals = await db.deals.find({
expected_close_date: {
gte: new Date(),
lte: addDays(new Date(), 7)
},
stage: { notIn: ['Closed Won', 'Closed Lost'] }
});
// Group by owner
const byOwner = groupBy(upcomingDeals, 'owner_id');
// Send summary to each owner
for (const [ownerId, deals] of Object.entries(byOwner)) {
await sendEmail({
to: deals[0].owner.email,
subject: `${deals.length} deals closing this week`,
body: renderDealList(deals)
});
}
What You've Accomplished
✅ Automatic email notifications
✅ Territory-based deal assignment
✅ Weekly digest emails
✅ Reminder workflows
✅ Slack/Teams integrations

offlineConfig: {
tables: ['companies', 'contacts', 'deals', 'activities'],
syncInterval: 300000, // 5 minutes
conflictResolution: 'lastWriteWins',
maxOfflineTime: 86400000 // 24 hours
}
Offline-first architecture:
All data cached locally in SQLite
Changes queued when offline
Auto-sync when connection restored
Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
Step 6: Push Notifications
Configure notifications:
Deal assigned to you:
Title: "New Deal Assigned"
Body: "{{ deal.title }} at {{ company.name }}"
Deep link: Open deal detail
Deal closing soon:
Title: "Deal Closing in 3 Days"
Body: "{{ deal.title }} - {{ deal.amount | currency }}"
Deep link: Open deal
Activity reminder:
Title: "Upcoming: {{ activity.subject }}"
Body: "{{ activity.type }} at {{ activity.due_time }}"
Action buttons: [Complete] [Snooze]
Step 7: Device Integrations
Business Card Scanner:
// Using device camera + OCR
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';
import { parseBusinessCard } from '@/lib/ocr';
async function scanBusinessCard() {
const photo = await Camera.takePictureAsync();
const data = await parseBusinessCard(photo.uri);
// Pre-fill contact form
contactForm.setValue({
name: data.name,
title: data.title,
company: data.company,
email: data.email,
phone: data.phone
});
}
Click-to-Call:
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
function callContact(phone) {
Linking.openURL(`tel:${phone}`);
// Log activity
createActivity({
type: 'call',
contact_id: contact.id,
subject: `Called ${contact.name}`
});
}
GPS Check-In:
import * as Location from 'expo-location';
async function checkInAtCompany(companyId) {
const location = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync();
createActivity({
type: 'meeting',
company_id: companyId,
subject: 'On-site visit',
location: {
lat: location.coords.latitude,
lng: location.coords.longitude
}
});
}

contacts, deals, and activities data. Help users find information,
create records, and get insights from their CRM data.
Always be concise and professional. When creating records, confirm
the details before saving.
Step 2: Give the Agent Tools
Available Tools:
Search Companies
tool: searchCompanies
description: Search for companies by name, industry, or size
parameters:
- query (string): Search term
- industry (string, optional)
- size (string, optional)
returns: List of matching companies
Search Contacts
Search Deals
Create Contact
Create Deal
Get Deal Summary
Log Activity
Step 3: Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Connect agent to your CRM data:
// Vector embeddings for semantic search
rag: {
enabled: true,
sources: [
{ table: 'companies', fields: ['name', 'industry', 'notes'] },
{ table: 'contacts', fields: ['full_name', 'title', 'notes'] },
{ table: 'deals', fields: ['title', 'notes'] },
{ table: 'activities', fields: ['subject', 'description'] }
],
vectorDB: 'pinecone', // or built-in
updateFrequency: 'realtime'
}
Now your agent can answer questions like:
"Show me all deals with tech companies over $50K"
"Who is the contact at Acme Corp?"
"What deals are closing this month?"
"Create a new contact at TechStart Inc"
Step 4: Email Draft Generation
Workflow integration:
User clicks: "Compose Email" on contact
AI generates personalized email based on:
- Contact relationship history
- Recent deals/activities
- Company context
- Email purpose (selected by user)
Example:
Purpose: Follow-up after demo
Generated:
Hi Sarah,
Thanks for taking the time to see our demo yesterday. Based on our
conversation about your team's workflow challenges, I think our
automation features would be particularly valuable.
I've attached a case study from a similar company in the healthcare
space that saw a 40% reduction in manual data entry.
Would next Tuesday work for a follow-up call to discuss implementation?
Best,
[Your name]
User can edit before sending.
Step 5: Meeting Summary Creation
After sales calls:
Upload call recording or paste transcript
AI generates:
- Summary of key points
- Action items
- Next steps
- Sentiment analysis
- Recommended deal stage
Auto-creates:
- Activity record with summary
- Tasks for action items
- Deal update if needed
Step 6: Intelligent Data Entry
Smart contact creation:
User: "Add John Smith, VP of Sales at Acme Corp, john@acme.com"
AI:
- Parses: name, title, company, email
- Checks if Acme Corp exists (finds it)
- Checks if john@acme.com exists (doesn't)
- Pre-fills form:
First Name: John
Last Name: Smith
Title: VP of Sales
Company: Acme Corp (linked)
Email: john@acme.com
- Asks: "Does this look correct?"
- User confirms
- Creates contact
Step 7: Chat Interface
Add AI chat widget to your CRM:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 💬 CRM Assistant
│
├─────────────────────────┤
│ You: Show me my deals
│
│ closing this week
│
│
│
│ AI: You have 3 deals
│
│ closing this week:
│
│
│
│ 1. Acme Corp - $50K
│
│

│
│
Stage: Negotiation
│
│
│
│ 2. TechStart - $25K
│
│
Close: Dec 17
│
│
Stage: Proposal
│
│
│
│ 3. Global Inc - $100K
│
│
Close: Dec 19
│
│

✅ Intelligent data entry
✅ Natural language queries
✅ RAG integration with your data
Day 6: Security & Permissions
Now let's lock down your CRM with enterprise-grade security.
Step 1: Row-Level Security (RLS)
Concept: Users only see records they own or have been shared with.
Enable RLS on tables:
-- Deals table
CREATE POLICY "users_see_own_deals" ON deals
FOR SELECT
USING (
owner_id = current_user_id()
OR
id IN (
SELECT deal_id FROM deal_shares WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
)
);
-- Companies, Contacts, Activities: Similar policies
Visual configuration (no SQL):
Table: deals
RLS Policy: "Own or Shared"
SELECT: owner_id = current_user OR deal_shares.user_id = current_user
INSERT: Always allow
UPDATE: owner_id = current_user OR deal_shares.permission = 'edit'
DELETE: owner_id = current_user
Step 2: Role-Based Access Control
Create roles:
Sales Rep
Can create/edit own deals, contacts, companies
Can view team members' deals (read-only)
Cannot delete anything
Cannot access admin settings
Sales Manager
Can view/edit all team deals
Can reassign deals
Can run reports
Cannot access billing
Admin
Full access to everything
Can manage users
Can configure workflows
Can export data
Step 3: Field-Level Security
Hide sensitive fields from certain roles:
Table: deals
Field: amount
Permissions:
- Sales Rep: Can see only their own deal amounts
- Sales Manager: Can see all amounts
- Admin: Can see all amounts
Table: contacts
Field: notes
Permissions:
- Owner: Full access
- Others: Can see, cannot edit
Step 4: OAuth / SAML SSO
Configure single sign-on:
Auth Methods:
☑ Email/Password
☑ Google OAuth
☑ Microsoft OAuth
☑ SAML 2.0 (for enterprise)
SAML Configuration:
Entity ID: https://yourcompany.com
ACS URL: https://api.algorithmshift.ai/auth/saml/acs
Certificate: [Upload]
Attribute Mapping:
email → email
firstName → first_name
lastName → last_name
role → role
Step 5: Audit Logging
Track all data changes:
auditLog: {
enabled: true,
events: [
'record.created',
'record.updated',
'record.deleted',
'user.login',
'user.logout',
'permission.changed',
'export.completed'
],
retention: 365, // days
includeFieldChanges: true
}
Audit log entry example:
{
"timestamp": "2025-11-23T10:30:00Z",
"user": "alex@company.com",
"action": "record.updated",
"table": "deals",
"record_id": "deal_123",
"changes": {
"stage": {
"from": "Proposal",
"to": "Negotiation"
},
"amount": {
"from": 45000,
"to": 50000
}
},
"ip_address": "192.168.1.1"
}
Step 6: Data Export Controls
Prevent unauthorized data extraction:
Export Permissions:
- Sales Rep: Cannot bulk export
- Sales Manager: Can export own team data
- Admin: Can export all data
Rate Limits:
- Max 1,000 records per export
- Max 5 exports per day
- Exports logged in audit trail
Watermarking:
- PDF exports include user email watermark
- CSV exports include export metadata
What You've Accomplished
✅ Row-level security
✅ Role-based access control
✅ Field-level permissions
✅ OAuth/SAML SSO
✅ Comprehensive audit logging
✅ Data export controls

The Real Comparison
Traditional CRM Implementation:
⏰ Time: 6-12 months
💰 Cost: $50,000-500,000
👥 Team: Implementation consultants, admins
🔒 Ownership: Zero
📱 Mobile: Limited/poor quality
🤖 AI: Locked to vendor's AI
⚖️ Flexibility: Constrained to platform
Your Custom CRM:
⏰ Time: 1 week
💰 Cost: $299/month (or $0 with free tier)
👥 Team: You (with visual tools + AI)
🔒 Ownership: 100% source code
📱 Mobile: Native iOS/Android
🤖 AI: Choose any LLM
⚖️ Flexibility: Build anything
What's Next?
Your CRM is live, but this is just the beginning.
Week 2 and beyond:
Add more features (forecasting, territories, quotas)
Integrate with email (Gmail, Outlook)
Connect to marketing tools
Build customer portal
Create sales playbooks
Add AI sales coaching
White-label for clients
The beauty: You can keep building. You own it.
Final Thoughts
You just did something most companies think is impossible: built a production-ready CRM in one week.
Not a prototype. Not a demo. A real, working application with:
Web and mobile interfaces
Automation
AI capabilities
Enterprise security
Source code you own
Traditional software vendors don't want you to know this is possible. They profit from the myth that custom software takes months and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.
But you've proven it's not true.
The question now is: What else will you build?

Perfect for REST clients, webhooks, and dynamic filtering.Why Shorthand Operators?Instead of sending a JSON body with complex filter objects, you can use simple URL parameters with bracket notation for common query patterns.Standard (verbose):POST with {"filter": {"price": {"gte": 100}}}Shorthand (simple):GET ?price[gte]=100Available Shorthand OperatorsOperatorMeaningExample[gte]Greater than or equalprice[gte]=100[lte]Less than or equalprice[lte]=500[gt]Greater thanstock[gt]=0[lt]Less thanpriority[lt]=5[ne]Not equalstatus[ne]=deleted[like]Pattern match (case-insensitive)name[like]=%john%[in]In array (comma-separated)status[in]=active,pending[nin]Not in arrayrole[nin]=admin,superadmin[null]Is null or not nulldeleted_at[null]=trueReal-World ExamplesDate Range (last 30 days):CopyGET /api/v1/tables/orders?created_at[gte]=2024-01-01&created_at[lte]=2024-01-31Price Range:CopyGET /api/v1/tables/products?price[gte]=100&price[lte]=500Multiple Statuses:CopyGET /api/v1/tables/tasks?status[in]=pending,in-progress,reviewSearch by Name:CopyGET /api/v1/tables/customers?name[like]=%smith%Exclude Deleted Records:CopyGET /api/v1/tables/users?deleted_at[null]=trueCombining Multiple Filters:CopyGET /api/v1/tables/leads?

Database-enforced access control that cannot be bypassed, with 5 layers of protection for your data.Why This System is SpecialUnlike traditional application-level security, AlgorithmShift enforces access control at the database level. This means:Cannot be bypassed: Security is enforced by PostgreSQL, not application codeAutomatic: No manual security checks needed in your codePerformant: Optimized at the database query levelFlexible: 5 complementary layers for any security requirementThe 5-Layer Security ModelAlgorithmShift's security system uses 5 complementary layers that work together to control data access:0Workspace Admin BypassFirst line of evaluationUsers with workspace_admin role automatically see all data, bypassing all other layers.Copy-- If user has workspace_admin role

1. OWD says: "You can only see your own records"
2. But other layers can EXPAND access:
- Ownership (Layer 2): + Records you own
- Groups (Layer 3): + Records from your groups
- Shares (Layer 4): + Records explicitly shared with you
- RLS Policies (Layer 5): + Records matching custom rules
Result: Private OWD + Group sharing = You see your records AND your team's records
Important: OWD sets the BASELINE. Other layers can only ADD more access,
never remove it (except Layer 5 RLS policies, which use AND logic).Learn MoreTable SettingsConfigure OWD and other table settingsOwnership & GroupsHow ownership expands on OWDHow Access WorksComplete access evaluation flowBuild web applications, mobile apps, workflows, and AI agents with visual tools and code-level controlProductPlatformSolutionsPricingIntegrationsResourcesDocumentationAPI ReferenceCase StudiesBlogCompanyCareersContactSecurityLegalPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceComplianceStatusStay UpdatedSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates and features.Subscribe© 2025 AlgorithmShift.

Grant access beyond ownership and group membership.What is Record Sharing?Record sharing allows you to grant access to specific records to specific principals (users, groups, or other records), regardless of ownership or group membership.sys_record_group_bindings TableAll record shares are stored in the sys_record_group_bindings table. This table links records to principals with specific access levels.Access LevelsWhen sharing a record, you specify one of three access levels:readView onlyUser can view the record but cannot edit or delete itread_writeView and editUser can view and edit the record but cannot delete or share itmanageFull controlUser can view, edit, delete, and share the record (like ownership)sys_record_group_bindings SchemaCopyCREATE TABLE sys_record_group_bindings (

-- 1. Sales creates account
INSERT INTO accounts (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES ('acc-123', 'Acme Corp', 'user-sales-alice');
-- 2. Share with Support team (read_write)
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings
VALUES (..., 'accounts', 'acc-123', 'grp-support', 'group', 'read_write');
-- Result:
-- ✓ Alice (owner) can see and edit
-- ✓ Sales team (via Alice's group) can see and edit
-- ✓ Support team (via explicit share) can see and edit
-- ✗ Marketing cannot see (no access)Example 2: Executive VisibilityCopy-- Scenario: CEO needs to see all high-value opportunities
-- 1. Create CEO group
INSERT INTO sys_groups (id, name) VALUES ('grp-executives', 'Executives');
-- 2. Share all opportunities > $100k with Executives (read-only)
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (

WHERE amount > 100000;
-- Result: CEO can view (but not edit) all high-value dealsExample 3: Hierarchical Record AccessCopy-- Scenario: Account → Contacts → Notes (all follow account access)
-- 1. Alice owns Account
INSERT INTO accounts (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES ('acc-456', 'Big Corp', 'user-alice');
-- 2. Create Contact, share with Account record
INSERT INTO contacts (id, name, account_id)
VALUES ('con-789', 'John Doe', 'acc-456');
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings
VALUES (..., 'contacts', 'con-789', 'acc-456', 'record', 'read_write');
-- 3. Create Note, share with Contact record
INSERT INTO notes (id, content, contact_id)
VALUES ('note-111', 'Important note', 'con-789');
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings
VALUES (..., 'notes', 'note-111', 'con-789', 'record', 'read');
-- Result:
-- Alice owns Account → Can see Account
-- Alice can see Account → Can see Contact (shared with Account)
-- Alice can see Contact → Can see Note (shared with Contact)
-- Transitive access through record-as-principal!Best PracticesUse shares for exceptionsShares are for special cases. Use OWD and groups for general access patterns.Share with groups, not individual usersSharing with groups is more maintainable as team membership changes.Use record-as-principal for relationshipsParent-child relationships are perfect for record-based sharing.Choose appropriate access levelsUse "read" for visibility, "read_write" for collaboration, "manage" rarely.Audit shares regularlyReview sys_record_group_bindings to ensure appropriate access.Learn MorePrincipals ConceptDeep dive into principal-based accessOwnership & GroupsAutomatic access through ownershipHow Access WorksComplete access evaluation flowBuild web applications, mobile apps, workflows, and AI agents with visual tools and code-level controlProductPlatformSolutionsPricingIntegrationsResourcesDocumentationAPI ReferenceCase StudiesBlogCompanyCareersContactSecurityLegalPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceComplianceStatusStay UpdatedSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates and features.Subscribe© 2025 AlgorithmShift.

The same permission name always generates the same UUID.Result: Check permissions in-memory with simple UUID array lookups. No database calls needed.How It WorksCopy// Permission name → Deterministic UUID (always the same)
"ps_tbl_customers_r" → "8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b"
"ps_tbl_customers_w" → "1b2c3d4e-5f6a-7b8c-9d0e-1f2a3b4c5d6e"
// User's permissions stored as UUID array
user.permissions = [
"8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b",
// read customers
"1b2c3d4e-5f6a-7b8c-9d0e-1f2a3b4c5d6e",
// write customers
...
]
// Permission check (in-memory, instant)
function hasPermission(permissionName) {
const uuid = generateUUIDv5(permissionName);
// Deterministic
return user.permissions.includes(uuid);
// Array lookup
}
// No database query needed! ⚡Permission Set Naming ConventionAll permission sets follow a consistent naming pattern:Table PermissionsCopyps_tbl_{table_name}_{operation}
Examples:
ps_tbl_customers_r
→ Read customers table
ps_tbl_customers_w
→ Write customers table
ps_tbl_customers_d
→ Delete from customers table
ps_tbl_opportunities_r
→ Read opportunities table
ps_tbl_opportunities_w
→ Write opportunities tableEntity/API PermissionsCopyps_entities_{operation}
Examples:
ps_entities_read
→ Read entity metadata
ps_entities_write
→ Write entity metadata
ps_entities_create
→ Create new entities
ps_entities_edit
→ Edit existing entities
ps_entities_delete
→ Delete entitiesFeature PermissionsCopyps_{feature}_{operation}
Examples:
ps_workflows_create
→ Create workflows
ps_workflows_execute
→ Execute workflows
ps_ai_agents_manage
→ Manage AI agents
ps_portals_admin
→ Administer portals
ps_reports_create
→ Create reports
ps_reports_export
→ Export report dataUUID v5 GenerationPermission UUIDs are generated using UUID v5 with a namespace:Copyimport { v5 as uuidv5 } from 'uuid';
// Workspace-specific namespace
const PERMISSION_NAMESPACE = 'workspace-123-permissions';
// Generate deterministic permission UUID
function getPermissionUUID(permissionName) {
return uuidv5(permissionName, PERMISSION_NAMESPACE);
}
// Example usage
const readCustomersUUID = getPermissionUUID('ps_tbl_customers_r');
// Always returns: "8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b"
// Multiple calls return the SAME UUID
console.log(getPermissionUUID('ps_tbl_customers_r'));
// "8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b"

Users, groups, and even records can be principals.What is a Principal?A principal is an entity that can participate in the security system. Think of it as "who or what" in "who has access to what". AlgorithmShift supports three types of principals.The Three Types of PrincipalsUser PrincipalIndividual accountsA user is the most common principal type• Can own records• Can be assigned permissions• Can have records shared with them• Can belong to groupsGroup PrincipalCollections of usersGroups can act as principals themselves• Can own records• Can have records shared with them• All members inherit access• Hierarchical relationshipsRecord PrincipalRecords as groupsRecords can act as implicit groups• Account → implicit group• Related records auto-shared• Hierarchical access• Parent-child relationshipsUser as PrincipalCopy-- User owns a customer record
INSERT INTO customers (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES ('cust-123', 'Acme Corp', 'user-alice');
-- User Alice can access this customer via ownership (Layer 2)
-- Record is shared with user Bob
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
entity_name, entity_id, principal_id, principal_type, access_level
) VALUES (
'customers', 'cust-123', 'user-bob', 'user', 'read'
);
-- User Bob can now access via sharing (Layer 4)Group as PrincipalGroups can own records and have records shared with them:Copy-- Group owns a record
INSERT INTO opportunities (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES ('opp-456', 'Big Deal', 'grp-sales-team');
-- ALL members of Sales Team can access via ownership
-- Alice (member of Sales Team) → Can access
-- Bob (member of Sales Team) → Can access
-- Charlie (NOT in Sales Team) → Cannot access
-- Record is shared with Engineering group
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
entity_name, entity_id, principal_id, principal_type, access_level
) VALUES (
'opportunities', 'opp-456', 'grp-engineering', 'group', 'read'
);
-- Now ALL members of Engineering can read via sharing (Layer 4)Record as Principal (Advanced)Records can act as implicit groups, enabling hierarchical access patterns:Example: Account HierarchyCopy-- Alice owns Account "Acme Corp"
INSERT INTO accounts (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES ('acc-123', 'Acme Corp', 'user-alice');
-- Contact is "shared with" the Account record (record-as-principal)
INSERT INTO contacts (id, name, account_id)
VALUES ('con-456', 'John Doe', 'acc-123');
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
entity_name, entity_id,
principal_id, principal_type, access_level
) VALUES (
'contacts', 'con-456',
'acc-123', 'record', 'read_write'
-- Account is the principal!
);
-- Result: Anyone who can access Account acc-123 can also access Contact con-456
-- Alice owns Account → Alice can access Contact
-- If Bob is granted access to Account → Bob can access Contact too
-- Transitive access through record-as-principal!Example: Multi-Level HierarchyCopy-- Three-level hierarchy: Account → Contact → Note
-- 1. Alice owns Account
INSERT INTO accounts VALUES ('acc-1', 'Acme', 'user-alice');
-- 2. Contact shared with Account (record-as-principal)
INSERT INTO contacts VALUES ('con-1', 'John', 'acc-1');
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings VALUES
('contacts', 'con-1', 'acc-1', 'record', 'read_write');
-- 3. Note shared with Contact (record-as-principal)
INSERT INTO notes VALUES ('note-1', 'Important', 'con-1');
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings VALUES
('notes', 'note-1', 'con-1', 'record', 'read');
-- Access Chain:
-- Alice owns Account acc-1
-- → Alice can access Contact con-1 (shared with acc-1)
-- → Alice can access Note note-1 (shared with con-1)
-- If Bob is granted access to the Account:
-- Bob gets access to Account → Contact → Note
-- Entire hierarchy cascades!Principal ResolutionHow the system determines which principals a user belongs to:Copy-- Function: current_user_principals()
-- Returns all principal IDs the current user belongs to
CREATE FUNCTION current_user_principals()
RETURNS UUID[] AS $$
SELECT ARRAY(
-- 1. User themselves
SELECT current_user_id()
UNION
-- 2. All groups user belongs to (with hierarchy)
SELECT group_id
FROM user_groups_hierarchy
WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
UNION
-- 3. All records user has access to (via ownership or sharing)
SELECT DISTINCT entity_id::uuid
FROM accessible_records
WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
);
$$ LANGUAGE SQL STABLE;
-- Usage in sharing check
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE EXISTS (
SELECT 1 FROM sys_record_group_bindings rgb
WHERE rgb.entity_name = 'customers'
AND rgb.entity_id = customers.id
AND rgb.principal_id IN (current_user_principals())
-- Check all principals
);Benefits of Principal-Based AccessFlexibility• Share with users, groups, or records• Create complex hierarchies• Model real-world organizations• Support multi-tenant scenariosMaintainability• Change group membership → access updates automatically• No need to reshare individual records• Hierarchies propagate changes• Single source of truthScalability• Efficient database queries• Works with millions of records• Indexed principal lookups• Cached principal resolutionIntuitive• Mirrors real-world relationships• "Give Sales Team access to Account"• Natural parent-child access• Matches user mental modelsLearn MoreIdentity ManagementCreate users and groupsRecord SharingShare with principalsOwnership & GroupsHow principals grant accessBuild web applications, mobile apps, workflows, and AI agents with visual tools and code-level controlProductPlatformSolutionsPricingIntegrationsResourcesDocumentationAPI ReferenceCase StudiesBlogCompanyCareersContactSecurityLegalPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceComplianceStatusStay UpdatedSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates and features.Subscribe© 2025 AlgorithmShift.

Define which users, roles, or API keys can access specific endpoints.API Resource ConceptAPI Resources are protected endpoints that require specific permissions. Combined with AlgorithmShift's deterministic permission UUID system, you get lightning-fast authorization checks.Why Protect API Resources?While RLS controls data access, API resource protection controls feature access.

default_access: 'private'
-- Then explicitly grant access via groups
-- Bad: Too open
default_access: 'public_read_write'
❌✓ Use Public Read for Reference DataTables like countries, states, categories can be public_read_only or public_read_write.✓ Use Controlled by Parent for Child RecordsOrder line items, contact notes, account attachments should inherit parent access.Groups & Hierarchies✓ Mirror Your Organization StructureCreate groups that match your real-world departments, teams, and regions.CopyCompany

└── Support✓ Use primary_group_id for Main TeamAssign records to the primary responsible team via primary_group_id.✓ Use secondary_group_id for Cross-FunctionalUse secondary_group_id for project teams, temporary collaborators, or secondary ownership.✗ Don't Create Too Many Nested LevelsKeep hierarchy depth under 5 levels for performance. More than 5 levels can slow queries.RLS Policies✓ Keep Policies SimpleComplex RLS policies impact query performance. Keep conditions simple and well-indexed.Copy-- Good: Simple, indexed
region = current_user_region()
-- Bad: Complex, unindexed
LOWER(region) LIKE LOWER(current_user_region() || '%')
❌✓ Index Fields Used in RLSCopy-- Create indexes for RLS policy fields
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_region ON customers(region);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_leads_assigned_to ON leads(assigned_to);✓ Test RLS Policies ThoroughlyTest with multiple user accounts to ensure policies work as expected and don't over-restrict.✗ Don't Use RLS for Business LogicRLS is for security, not business rules. Use application logic or database triggers for business rules.Roles & Permissions✓ Follow Principle of Least PrivilegeGrant only the minimum permissions needed for users to do their job.✓ Use Roles, Not Individual PermissionsCreate roles (Sales Rep, Support Agent) and assign roles, not individual permissions.✓ Grant workspace_admin SparinglyAdmin role bypasses ALL security. Only grant to fully trusted users.✓ Regular Access ReviewsQuarterly review of who has what permissions. Remove access no longer needed.Field-Level Security✓ Hide PII from Regular UsersCopy-- Hide sensitive fields
access_level: 'none' for SSN, DOB, Tax ID✓ Mask Financial DataCopy-- Mask instead of hide when UI needs field
access_level: 'read', mask_value: true
-- Shows: ****-****-****-1234✓ Make Audit Fields Read-Onlycreated_at, created_by, updated_at, updated_by should be read-only for all users.Sharing & Collaboration✓ Share with Groups, Not UsersSharing with groups is more maintainable as team membership changes.✓ Use Appropriate Access Levels• read - For visibility only• read_write - For collaboration• manage - Rarely needed (like ownership)✗ Don't Over-ShareExcessive manual shares make security hard to audit. Use groups and OWD instead when possible.Performance OptimizationDatabase IndexesCopyCREATE INDEX idx_owner ON customers(owner_id);
