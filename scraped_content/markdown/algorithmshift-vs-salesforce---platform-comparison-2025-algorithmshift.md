## Choose AlgorithmShift When...

AlgorithmShift is perfect for teams who need more than a traditional CRM

### You need more than a CRM

Build customer portals, mobile apps, admin dashboards, and custom workflows - not just sales tracking

### You want modern tech stack

Use React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL instead of proprietary Apex and SOQL languages

### You need native mobile apps

Build real iOS and Android apps for customers and field teams, not just mobile web wrappers

### You want to control costs

Pay per workspace, not per user - massive savings as your team scales

### You value flexibility

Start with visual tools, add code when needed. Export and migrate anytime without vendor lock-in

### You need faster deployment

Launch in weeks, not months. No lengthy implementation projects or expensive consultants

## The Bottom Line

Choose Salesforce if: You need a proven CRM with established ecosystem, have significant budget, and don't mind vendor lock-in or per-user pricing.

Choose AlgorithmShift if: You want to build custom applications (not just CRM), need native mobile apps, value modern tech stack, want flexible pricing, and prefer zero vendor lock-in.
