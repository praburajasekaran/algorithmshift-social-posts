## Choose AlgorithmShift When...

Perfect for teams who value performance and flexibility

### Need real performance

Build fast React apps with <100ms load times, not slow Bubble apps

### Break through no-code walls

Start with visual tools, add code when needed - don't hit artificial limits

### Build native mobile apps

Create real iOS and Android apps, not just responsive web wrappers

### Modern tech stack

Use React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL that developers actually know

### Avoid vendor lock-in

Export to standard React code and migrate anytime - don't get trapped

### Scale with confidence

Handle millions of users without performance degradation

## The Bottom Line

Choose Bubble if: You're building a simple MVP with minimal traffic and don't care about performance, mobile apps, or future flexibility.

Choose AlgorithmShift if: You want fast performance, need to scale, want native mobile apps, need code access when you hit limits, and don't want to be locked into a proprietary platform.

"Bubble is great for prototypes. AlgorithmShift is built for production apps that need performance, scale, and professional development."
