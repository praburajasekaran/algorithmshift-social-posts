## Choose AlgorithmShift When...

Perfect for teams wanting modern development without Microsoft lock-in

### Modern tech stack matters

Use React and TypeScript that millions of developers know, not proprietary Power Apps

### Need native mobile apps

Build true native iOS/Android apps, not Power Apps canvas apps

### Want multi-cloud flexibility

Not locked into Azure - deploy anywhere or use our infrastructure

### Avoid Microsoft lock-in

Export to standard code and migrate anytime without being held hostage

### Cost predictability

Simple per-workspace pricing vs complex per-user Power Platform licensing

### Rapid development

Ship in weeks, not months of complex Dynamics implementation

## The Bottom Line

Choose Microsoft Dynamics if: You're already heavily invested in the Microsoft ecosystem (Office 365, Azure, Teams) and need deep CRM/ERP integration.

Choose AlgorithmShift if: You want modern React/TypeScript development, native mobile apps, multi-cloud flexibility, and don't want to be locked into the Microsoft ecosystem.

"Power Apps for canvas apps? Try React Native for real native mobile apps. Dataverse locked to Azure? Try PostgreSQL that works anywhere."
