## Choose AlgorithmShift When...

Perfect for teams who need more power than no-code tools can provide

### Need code-level control

Break through no-code limitations with full React/TypeScript access when you need it

### Build beyond CRM

Create custom portals, internal tools, and applications outside of CRM workflows

### Native mobile apps

Build real iOS and Android apps, not just mobile-responsive web views

### Modern tech stack

Use standard React and TypeScript instead of proprietary Deluge scripting

### Database flexibility

Design custom database schemas with PostgreSQL, not limited to Zoho modules

### Avoid vendor lock-in

Export your code and data anytime - don't get trapped in Zoho's ecosystem

## The Bottom Line

Choose Zoho if: You need a simple, affordable CRM with basic no-code tools and don't anticipate needing deep customization.

Choose AlgorithmShift if: You want the speed of visual tools but need the power of code when you hit limitations. Build beyond CRM with native mobile apps and custom applications.

"No-code is great until you need something custom. AlgorithmShift gives you visual tools AND full code access - best of both worlds."
