## Key Concepts

Before diving in, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

### Workspaces

A workspace is your development environment where you create and manage applications. Each workspace has its own database, APIs, and team members.

### Applications

Applications are the web or mobile apps you build. Each application can have multiple pages, components, and workflows.

### Database Tables

Your data is stored in PostgreSQL tables. Create tables visually and get automatic REST and GraphQL APIs.

### Workflows

Workflows automate business logic and processes. Trigger actions based on events like database changes, webhooks, or schedules.

### AI Agents

AI agents are conversational interfaces powered by large language models. They can access your data and take actions on your behalf.
