## Choose AlgorithmShift When...

Perfect for teams who need more than marketing and sales automation

### Build beyond marketing & sales

Create customer portals, mobile apps, operations tools - not limited to marketing/sales/service

### Need custom data models

Design your own database schemas instead of being forced into HubSpot's predefined objects

### Want native mobile apps

Build real iOS and Android apps for field teams and customers

### Control your costs

Predictable pricing without hidden costs for contacts, workflows, or AI features

### Technical flexibility

Use modern tech stack (React/TypeScript) and export code anytime - no lock-in

### Multi-LLM AI strategy

Choose the best AI model for each use case instead of being locked to Breeze AI

## The Bottom Line

Choose HubSpot if: You specifically need an all-in-one marketing, sales, and service CRM and don't need custom applications or mobile development.

Choose AlgorithmShift if: You want to build custom applications beyond CRM, need native mobile apps, want code-level control, prefer transparent pricing, and value technical flexibility.

"HubSpot is a CRM with workflows. AlgorithmShift is a platform to build anything - CRMs, mobile apps, portals, and AI agents."
