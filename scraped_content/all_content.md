Introduction - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationDocumentation
# Welcome to AlgorithmShift.

Build production-ready web applications, mobile apps, workflows, and AI agents with our enterprise-grade platform.

## What is AlgorithmShift?

AlgorithmShift is a comprehensive full-stack development platform that enables you to build, deploy, and scale applications faster than ever before. Whether you're creating web applications, mobile apps, automating workflows, or building AI-powered features, AlgorithmShift provides all the tools you need in one unified platform.

## Core Features

AlgorithmShift combines visual development tools with code-level control, giving you the speed of no-code with the flexibility of traditional development.
[### Visual App Builder

### Ready to get started?

Follow our comprehensive quick start guide to build your first application.
[Quick Start Guide](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/quick-start)
## Key Concepts

Before diving in, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

### Workspaces

A workspace is your development environment where you create and manage applications. Each workspace has its own database, APIs, and team members.

### Applications

Applications are the web or mobile apps you build. Each application can have multiple pages, components, and workflows.

### Database Tables

Your data is stored in PostgreSQL tables. Create tables visually and get automatic REST and GraphQL APIs.

### Workflows

Workflows automate business logic and processes. Trigger actions based on events like database changes, webhooks, or schedules.

### AI Agents

AI agents are conversational interfaces powered by large language models. They can access your data and take actions on your behalf.

REST API Reference - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationAPI Reference
# REST API Reference

Auto-generated REST APIs for every table in your workspace. Powerful querying, filtering, sorting, and pagination out of the box.

### Auto-Generated

APIs created with your tables

### CRUD Operations

Create, read, update, delete

### Secure by Default

RLS policies enforced

## Base URL
Copy
```
# Production
https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1

# Your workspace API base
https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1/ws/{workspaceSlug}
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys:

### API Key Authentication

#### Authorization Header
Copy
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

Quick Start - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationGetting Started
# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with AlgorithmShift in 5 minutes. This guide will walk you through creating your first application.

### What You'll Build

In this quick start, you'll create a simple task management application with:

- ✓ Database tables for storing tasks
- ✓ Auto-generated REST APIs
- ✓ Visual app builder interface
- ✓ User authentication
- ✓ Deployed to production

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

AlgorithmShift Account

Sign up at algorithmshift.ai

Web Browser

Chrome, Firefox, or Safari

## Step 1: Create a Workspace

A workspace is your isolated development environment. Each workspace has its own database, APIs, and team members.
1
### Navigate to the Dashboard

After logging in, you'll be prompted to create your first workspace.
Copy
```
// Your workspace will be automatically provisioned with:
- PostgreSQL database (isolated schema)
- REST API endpoints
- GraphQL API
- Authentication system
- Storage bucket (AWS S3)
```
2
### Enter Workspace Details

Provide a name and slug for your workspace.

Workspace Name

My Company

Workspace Slug

my-company (used in URLs)
3
### Workspace Created!

Your workspace is now ready. You'll automatically be assigned as the workspace_admin.

## Step 2: Create a Database Table

Let's create a table to store our tasks. AlgorithmShift will automatically generate REST APIs for this table.

### Using the Visual Schema Designer

1. 1. Navigate to Data Management → Tables
1. 2. Click "Create Table"
1. 3. Name it tasks
1. 4. Add the following columns:
Column NameTypeConstraints`id`UUIDPrimary Key`title`VARCHAR(255)NOT NULL`description`TEXT-`status`VARCHAR(50)Default: 'pending'`created_at`TIMESTAMPDefault: NOW()
### Auto-Generated APIs

When you create a table, AlgorithmShift automatically generates REST APIs:
Copy
```
GET    /api/v1/tables/tasks          # List all tasks
POST   /api/v1/tables/tasks          # Create a task
GET    /api/v1/tables/tasks/:id      # Get single task
PUT    /api/v1/tables/tasks/:id      # Update a task
DELETE /api/v1/tables/tasks/:id      # Delete a task
```

## Step 3: Test Your API

Let's test the auto-generated API by creating a task.

#### Using cURL
Copy
```
curl -X POST \
  https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1/tables/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My First Task",
    "description": "Testing the API",
    "status": "pending"
  }'
```

#### Using JavaScript
Copy
```
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1/tables/tasks',
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      title: 'My First Task',
      description: 'Testing the API',
      status: 'pending'
    })
  }
);
const task = await response.json();
```

#### API Response
Copy
```
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "title": "My First Task",
    "description": "Testing the API",
    "status": "pending",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Build the User Interface

Now let's create a visual interface for our task management app using the drag-and-drop builder.

### Create Your First App

1. 1. Navigate to App Builder → Apps
1. 2. Click "Create App"
1. 3. Choose "Web App" or "Mobile App"
1. 4. Name it "Task Manager"
1. 5. Click "Open Builder"
+
### Add Components to Your Page

Drag and drop components from the left sidebar onto the canvas:

Container

Layout wrapper

Table

Display tasks

Form

Add new tasks

Button

Actions

### Connect to Your Data

Bind the Table component to your tasks table:

1. 1. Select the Table component
1. 2. In the properties panel, set Data Source to "tasks"
1. 3. The table will automatically display your tasks

## Step 5: Add Authentication

Protect your app with built-in authentication.
Copy
```
// Enable authentication in your app settings
{
  "authentication": {
    "required": true,
    "providers": ["email", "google"],
    "redirectUrl": "/dashboard"
  }
}
```

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

For multi-user apps, enable RLS on your tasks table so users can only see their own tasks. Learn more in the RLS documentation.

## Step 6: Deploy Your App

Deploy your app to production with a single click.

### Instant Deploy

Click "Deploy" button in the app builder

### Auto Scaling

Your app automatically scales with traffic

### Live URL

Get a production URL instantly
Copy
```
# Your app is now live at:
https://your-workspace.algorithmshift.app/task-manager

# Or use a custom domain:
https://tasks.yourcompany.com
```

ResourceURL PatternExampleAdmin App`/[workspace]`/my-company/appApp Builder`/[workspace]/app/[appId]/builder`/my-company/app/123/builderREST API`/api/v1/tables/[table]`/api/v1/tables/tasksGraphQL`/graphql/[workspace]`/graphql/my-companyPortal`/portals/[portalId]`/portals/customer-portalPublished App`[workspace].algorithmshift.app`my-company.algorithmshift.app
## API Endpoints Structure

All workspace APIs follow consistent patterns:

### Admin API

Workspace administration and configuration
Copy
```
# Base URL
https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1/

# Endpoints
/workspaces                    # Workspace management
/apps                         # Application CRUD
/workflows                    # Workflow management
/agents                       # AI agent management
/portals                      # Portal management
/knowledge-base              # Knowledge base operations
```

### Client API

Data access and business logic
Copy
```
# Base URL
https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1/

# Data Operations
/tables/{table_name}          # CRUD operations
/views/{view_name}            # View queries
/entities/{table_name}        # Advanced queries with filters

# Access Control
/users                        # User management
/groups                       # Group operations
/permissions                  # Permission checks
/roles                        # Role assignments
```

## Environment Isolation

Use multiple workspaces to separate environments:

### Development

Active development and testing

my-company-dev

### Staging

Pre-production testing

my-company-staging

### Production

Live applications

my-company

}
```
2
### Design with Mobile Components

The component library automatically shows mobile components:
Copy
```
// Example: Login Screen
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text style={styles.title}>Welcome Back</Text>
  
  <TextInput
    placeholder="Email"
    keyboardType="email-address"
    autoCapitalize="none"
  />
  
  <TextInput
    placeholder="Password"
    secureTextEntry={true}
  />
  
  <TouchableOpacity 
    style={styles.button}

### Connect to Data

Mobile apps use the same APIs as web apps:
Copy
```
// FlatList with API data
<FlatList
  data={tasks}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <View style={styles.taskItem}>
      <Text style={styles.taskTitle}>{item.title}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.taskStatus}>{item.status}</Text>
    </View>
  )}
  keyExtractor={item => item.id}
  refreshing={loading}
  onRefresh={loadTasks}
/>

// API call
const loadTasks = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    'https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1/tables/tasks',
    {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
      }
    }
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  setTasks(data.data);
};
```
5

# Database & APIs - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShift

**URL:** https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/database

**Description:** Build and manage PostgreSQL databases with auto-generated REST and GraphQL APIs.

---

Database & APIs - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationDatabase & APIs
# Database & Data Management

Every workspace includes a PostgreSQL database with auto-generated REST and GraphQL APIs. Design your schema visually, and APIs are created instantly.

### PostgreSQL 15

Full-featured relational database

### Auto APIs

REST & GraphQL generated automatically

### Visual Designer

Design schemas with drag & drop

### Row-Level Security

Built-in data access control

### Relationships

Foreign keys and joins

### Views

Complex queries as virtual tables

## How It Works

When you create a workspace, AlgorithmShift provisions a dedicated PostgreSQL database schema with full isolation.

### Database Provisioning
Copy
```
// Your workspace database schema
Schema: ws_my_company

// Connection details (available in workspace settings)
{
  "host": "db.algorithmshift.ai",
  "port": 5432,
  "database": "algorithmshift",
  "schema": "ws_my_company",
  "ssl": true,
  "maxConnections": 100
}
```

## Creating Tables

Use the visual table designer to create database tables without writing SQL.
1
### Navigate to Tables

Go to Access Control → Data Management → Tables
Copy
```
// URL Pattern
/{workspaceId}/access-control/data-management/tables
```
2
### Define Table Structure

Click "Create Table" and define columns:
ColumnTypeConstraints`id`UUIDPRIMARY KEY, DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4()`name`VARCHAR(255)NOT NULL`email`VARCHAR(255)UNIQUE, NOT NULL`status`VARCHAR(50)DEFAULT 'active'`created_at`TIMESTAMPDEFAULT NOW()3
### APIs Created Automatically

As soon as you create a table, REST APIs are generated:
Copy
```
# List all records
GET /api/v1/tables/customers

# Create a record
POST /api/v1/tables/customers
Body: { "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" }

# Get single record
GET /api/v1/tables/customers/:id

# Update a record
PUT /api/v1/tables/customers/:id
Body: { "status": "inactive" }

# Delete a record
DELETE /api/v1/tables/customers/:id
```

## Supported Data Types

AlgorithmShift supports all standard PostgreSQL data types:

### Text Types

- VARCHAR(n) - Variable length
- TEXT - Unlimited length
- CHAR(n) - Fixed length

### Numeric Types

- INTEGER - Whole numbers
- BIGINT - Large integers
- DECIMAL(p,s) - Exact decimals
- FLOAT - Floating point

### Date & Time

- TIMESTAMP - Date and time
- DATE - Date only
- TIME - Time only
- INTERVAL - Time span

### Boolean & Binary

- BOOLEAN - True/false
- BYTEA - Binary data
- UUID - Unique identifier

### JSON Types

- JSON - JSON data
- JSONB - Binary JSON (faster)

### Arrays & Special

- ARRAY - Array of values
- ENUM - Enumerated type
- POINT - Geometric point

## Query Your Data

The auto-generated APIs support powerful querying capabilities:

### Filtering
Copy
```
# Exact match
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?status=active

# Comparison operators
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?created_at[gte]=2024-01-01

# Multiple conditions (AND)
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?status=active&priority=high

# IN operator
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?status[in]=active,pending

# Pattern matching
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?title[like]=%urgent%
```

### Sorting & Pagination
Copy
```
# Sort by field (ascending)
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?sort=created_at

# Sort descending
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?sort=-created_at

# Multiple sort fields
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?sort=priority,-created_at

# Pagination
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?page=1&pageSize=20

# Limit results
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?limit=10&offset=0
```

### Field Selection
Copy
```
# Select specific fields
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?fields=id,title,status

# Exclude fields
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?exclude=description,metadata

# Expand foreign keys
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?expand=assigned_user,project
```

## Relationships

Define relationships between tables with foreign keys:

### One-to-Many Relationship

Example: A project has many tasks
Copy
```
// tasks table
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "varchar(255)",
  "project_id": "uuid",  // Foreign key
  "created_at": "timestamp"
}

// Foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE tasks
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_tasks_project
FOREIGN KEY (project_id)
REFERENCES projects(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

Query with expansion:
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?expand=project

Response:
{
  "data": [{
    "id": "123",
    "title": "Task 1",
    "project": {
      "id": "456",
      "name": "Project Alpha",
      "status": "active"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Many-to-Many Relationship

Example: Users can belong to multiple groups
Copy
```
// Junction table: user_groups
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "group_id": "uuid",
  "created_at": "timestamp"
}

// Query users with their groups
GET /api/v1/tables/users?expand=groups

Response:
{
  "data": [{
    "id": "user-1",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "groups": [
      { "id": "group-1", "name": "Developers" },
      { "id": "group-2", "name": "Admins" }
    ]
  }]
}
```

# The $300K Trap: Why Smart Companies Are Ditching Traditional CRMs in 2025

After spending $300K over 5 years on traditional CRMs, companies are realizing they own nothing. Learn why the smartest businesses are making the switch to platforms that give them true ownership.
S[Shankar Prabhu](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/blog/author/shankar-prabhu)November 23, 202512 min readShare:
# The $300K Trap: Why Smart Companies Are Ditching Traditional CRMs in 2025

## Introduction: The Wake-Up Call

Last month, I spoke with the CTO of a mid-sized logistics company. They'd been using Salesforce for three years, spending roughly $15,000 per month—$180,000 total. When their vendor announced a 40% price increase, they decided to explore alternatives.

That's when they discovered the trap.

After three years and nearly $200,000 invested in customizations, workflows, and business logic, they couldn't export any of it. Their entire sales process, customer relationships, and operational workflows were locked in a proprietary system they didn't own.

They had two choices: pay the ransom or start over.

This story isn't unique. It's happening to thousands of companies right now. And it's exactly why 2025 is becoming the year of the great CRM exodus.

## The Three Traps That Cost Companies Everything

### 💸 Trap #1: The Cost Trap

Let's talk about real numbers. Here's what a traditional CRM actually costs for a 20-person team over 5 years:

Salesforce Sales Cloud + AI:

- Base License: $150/user × 20 × 12 months × 5 years = $180,000
- AI Features (Agentforce): $50/user × 20 × 12 months × 5 years = $60,000
- SSO/SAML: $5,000/year × 5 years = $25,000
- Extra Storage: $2,000/year × 5 years = $10,000
- API Limit Overages: $3,000/year × 5 years = $15,000
- Implementation & Training: $40,000 (one-time)
- Total: $330,000+

HubSpot Enterprise Stack:

- Sales Hub Professional: $1,600/month × 60 months = $96,000
- Marketing Hub Professional: $1,000/month × 60 months = $60,000
- Service Hub Professional: $1,000/month × 60 months = $60,000
- Breeze AI agents: $800/month × 60 months = $48,000
- Total: $264,000+

Microsoft Dynamics 365:

- Sales Professional: $120/user × 20 × 12 × 5 = $144,000
- Copilot Studio: $50/user × 20 × 12 × 5 = $60,000
- Implementation: $25,000
- Total: $229,000+

And these are conservative estimates. Many companies end up spending 30-50% more due to:

- Premium support contracts
- Additional user licenses as they grow
- Third-party integrations and plugins
- Consultant fees for customizations
- Training and certification programs

### 🔒 Trap #2: The Coding Trap

Here's where the "no-code" marketing falls apart.

Traditional CRM vendors market themselves as "no-code" or "low-code" platforms. But the moment you need real customization—which is almost immediately—you discover the truth:

Salesforce requires Apex, a proprietary Java-like language:

- 6-12 month learning curve for experienced developers
- Limited talent pool (specialized Salesforce developers command $150K+/year)
- Skills are completely wasted if you ever leave the platform
- Requires additional learning: SOQL (proprietary SQL), Lightning Web Components, Visualforce

Microsoft Dynamics requires C# plugins and Power Apps:

- 3-6 month learning curve
- Power Fx (proprietary formula language)
- Complex, expensive licensing for development tools
- Heavy Microsoft ecosystem lock-in

HubSpot offers very limited customization:

- Basic workflows only
- Custom properties but no real data modeling
- Forced into HubSpot's way of doing things
- Any serious customization requires expensive agency help

The irony is brutal: You chose a CRM to avoid hiring developers, but end up needing specialized developers who cost even more.

### ⛓️ Trap #3: The Ownership Trap (The Biggest One)

This is the trap that companies don't realize they're in until it's too late.

After spending $300K over 5 years, you own:

- ❌ Zero source code
- ❌ Zero exportable business logic
- ❌ Zero intellectual property
- ❌ Zero leverage

What you do have:

- ✅ Data (contacts, deals) in the vendor's format
- ✅ A monthly bill that keeps increasing
- ✅ Complete dependence on the vendor

### The Real-World Impact

Let me share what this looks like in practice:

Scenario 1: The Price Increase
Your CRM vendor raises prices 40%. You can't negotiate because they know you can't leave. Migration would cost $75K+ and take 12-18 months. You're held hostage.

Scenario 2: The Feature You Need
Your business has a unique workflow that's core to your competitive advantage. Your CRM can't support it without extensive (read: expensive) custom development. You either compromise your business process or pay a consultant $200/hour to build it in a proprietary language you don't control.

Scenario 3: The Acquisition
Your CRM vendor gets acquired. The new owner changes the product direction, discontinues features you rely on, or doubles the price. You have no recourse.

Scenario 4: The Scale Problem
You grow from 20 to 200 employees. Your CRM bill goes from $4,000/month to $40,000/month—even though your actual infrastructure costs barely increased. Per-user pricing is a tax on success.

## Why 2025 Is Different: The Perfect Storm

Several forces have converged to make 2025 the inflection point:

### 1. AI Has Democratized Development

Before 2024: Building custom software required months of developer time
Now: AI can generate production-ready code from natural language descriptions

This fundamentally changes the build vs. buy equation. Building custom software is suddenly 10x faster and cheaper.

### 2. React Has Become Universal

There are 13+ million React developers worldwide. React isn't just popular—it's the standard. This means:

- Massive talent pool (easy and affordable to hire)
- Huge ecosystem of components and tools
- No vendor lock-in—React skills transfer everywhere

Compare this to:

- Salesforce Apex developers: Maybe 100,000 globally
- Microsoft Dynamics C# specialists: Limited pool
- Both command premium salaries due to scarcity

### 3. Vendor Lock-In Fatigue Has Reached Critical Mass

The horror stories are piling up:

- 40% price increases with no notice
- Essential features moved to higher tiers
- Arbitrary API limits causing outages
- Forced migration to new platforms (remember Salesforce Classic → Lightning?)

Companies are fed up. The Twitter/X threads about CRM horror stories go viral weekly.

### 4. Mobile-First Is No Longer Optional

60% of enterprise applications now need mobile versions. Traditional CRMs offer:

- Mobile-responsive web views (slow, poor UX)
- Wrapped web apps (still poor performance)
- Expensive native app development (if they offer it at all)

Modern businesses need real native mobile apps. CRMs can't deliver.

### 5. The Economics Have Flipped

Old Math:

- Build custom: $200K+ in developer time
- Buy CRM: $50K/year (seems cheaper!)

New Math:

- Build custom on modern platform: $10-20K in time
- Buy CRM: Still $50K/year
- Build is now 60-80% cheaper

## The Alternative: What's Different Now?

The solution isn't to buy a different CRM. It's to stop renting software and start owning it.

Here's what the new approach looks like:

### 1. Build Exactly What You Need

Instead of forcing your business into Salesforce's data model, design your application around your actual workflow.

Example: Property Management Company

Traditional CRM approach:

- Try to map "Properties" to "Accounts"
- Map "Tenants" to "Contacts"
- Map "Maintenance Requests" to "Cases"
- Fight with the system constantly because it's not designed for property management

Custom platform approach:

- Create a "Properties" table with fields that matter to you
- Create a "Tenants" table with lease information, payment history, etc.
- Create a "Maintenance" table with request types, photos, assignments
- Build exactly the workflow your team needs

### 2. Use Modern Tools That Give You Speed AND Control

The best modern platforms offer three ways to build:

Visual Builder: For speed

- Drag-and-drop interface
- 60+ pre-built components
- No coding required for 80% of features
- Build in days, not months

AI Prompt-to-Code: For complexity

- Describe what you want in plain English
- AI generates the code
- Review, test, deploy
- Handle advanced features in minutes

Standard Code Access: For ultimate control

- React, TypeScript, Node.js (standard technologies)
- Export your source code anytime
- Hire from a pool of millions of developers
- Never locked in

### 3. Own Your Source Code

This is the game-changer. Imagine if:

- You could export your entire CRM as React/TypeScript source code
- You could run it on AWS, Azure, or your own servers
- You could hire any React developer to maintain it
- The platform shut down tomorrow, and you'd still have working applications

That's not hypothetical. That's what true ownership looks like.

## Real-World Example: The UrbanHomes Story

Let me share a real example (details slightly changed for privacy):

UrbanHomes Property Management

- Managing 500+ rental properties
- 15-person team
- Tech-savvy but not developers

Their Salesforce Experience:

- $4,000/month ($48,000/year)
- Couldn't properly model properties, units, leases
- Mobile app was basically unusable for maintenance staff
- Every customization required expensive consultants
- Total 3-year cost: $160,000+

Their Switch to AlgorithmShift:

- Built custom property management system in 4 weeks
- Features:

Tenant self-service portal
Native mobile app for maintenance team (works offline!)
Automated rent reminders and maintenance routing
Custom dashboard with occupancy, financials, maintenance status
- Cost: $299/month ($3,588/year)
- 5-year savings: $220,000+

The Best Part:
They own the source code. If they ever want to:

- Self-host on AWS
- Hire a developer to add features
- Migrate to a different platform
They can. No permission needed. No ransom payment. No starting over.

## The Decision Framework: When to Stay vs. When to Leave

Not every company should abandon their CRM tomorrow. Here's how to decide:

### Stay with Traditional CRM If:

- ❓ You use only basic features (contact management, deal tracking)
- ❓ You have zero technical resources and can't hire any
- ❓ You're in a highly regulated industry requiring specific CRM certifications (rare)
- ❓ Your CRM is so deeply integrated it would take >18 months to migrate (but start planning now)

### Consider the Switch If:

- ✅ You're customizing heavily (Apex code, complex workflows)
- ✅ You're spending $30K+/year on your CRM
- ✅ You need mobile apps for field teams
- ✅ You need features your CRM doesn't support
- ✅ Your CRM bill keeps increasing
- ✅ You have (or can hire) at least one technical person
- ✅ You're building multiple applications (CRM + portal + internal tools)
- ✅ You value ownership and flexibility

## 10 Questions to Ask Before Renewing Your CRM Contract

Before you sign that renewal, ask your vendor:

1. Can I export my source code and business logic?

(Hint: The answer is no)
1. What happens if you increase prices by 40% next year?

(Hint: You pay or lose everything)
1. Can I self-host this on my own infrastructure?

(Hint: Not without enterprise mega-contracts)
1. Who owns the customizations my team builds?

(Hint: They do, not you)
1. Can I hire any developer to maintain this, or do I need specialists?

(Hint: You need expensive specialists)
1. What does it cost to migrate away from your platform?

(Hint: $50K-100K+ and 12-18 months)
1. Do your mobile apps have feature parity with the web?

(Hint: No, they're web wrappers)
1. Can I use any AI model I want, or am I locked to yours?

(Hint: Locked to theirs)
1. What happens if you get acquired or change direction?

(Hint: You're screwed)
1. If I spend $300K over 5 years, what do I own at the end?

(Hint: Nothing)

If these answers bother you, you're in the trap.

## The Path Forward

The future of business software isn't buying CRMs with AI features bolted on. It's building exactly what your business needs on platforms that give you:

- ✅ Speed (visual tools + AI)
- ✅ Power (full code access when needed)
- ✅ Ownership (export anytime)
- ✅ Flexibility (any use case, not just CRM)
- ✅ Affordability (per-workspace, not per-user)

Companies that make this shift are:

- Saving $200K+ over 5 years
- Building better applications faster
- Owning their intellectual property
- Never worrying about vendor lock-in again

## Conclusion: The $300K Question

Here's the question every company needs to ask:

"If we spend $300K over 5 years, shouldn't we own something at the end?"

Traditional CRMs say: "No, you rent forever."

The new generation of platforms says: "Yes, here's your source code."

The choice is yours. But remember: Every month you stay in the trap is another month of rent you'll never get back.

The trap is optional. Ownership is available. The only question is: How much longer will you rent?

# How to Build a Production-Ready CRM in One Week (Step-by-Step Guide)

## Introduction: A Different Kind of Tutorial

When companies tell me they need a CRM, I ask them: "Do you need a CRM, or do you need software that manages your customer relationships the way YOUR business works?"

There's a huge difference.

Traditional CRMs force you into their model. Salesforce wants you to use Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, and Cases—regardless of whether that matches your business. HubSpot gives you Marketing, Sales, and Service Hubs with rigid workflows.

What if you could build exactly what you need? Not in 6-12 months with a six-figure budget, but in one week?

This guide will show you how.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this week, you'll have:

✅ Custom Database Schema

- Companies, Contacts, Deals, Activities tables
- Relationships and validation rules
- Full SQL access for advanced queries

✅ Web Application

- Contact management with search and filters
- Deal pipeline with drag-and-drop Kanban board
- Activity timeline and notes
- Analytics dashboard with charts
- Responsive design (works on all devices)

✅ Native Mobile Apps

- iOS and Android from the same codebase
- Offline mode for field sales reps
- Push notifications for deal updates
- Camera integration for business card scanning

✅ Workflow Automation

- Email automation when deal stages change
- Auto-assign deals based on territory or criteria
- Weekly digest emails
- Slack/Teams notifications

✅ AI-Powered Features

- Chatbot that answers questions about contacts and deals
- Email draft generation
- Meeting summary creation
- Data entry assistance

✅ Security & Permissions

- Row-level security (sales reps see only their deals)
- Role-based access control
- OAuth/SAML SSO integration
- Audit logging

Most Importantly: You'll own the complete React/TypeScript source code. Export it anytime, run it anywhere, hire any developer to maintain it.

## Prerequisites

What you'll need:

- A free AlgorithmShift account (sign up at [algorithmshift.ai](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/blog/build-production-ready-crm-in-one-week))
- Basic understanding of databases (what's a table, field, relationship)
- Optional: React/TypeScript knowledge for advanced customization

What you DON'T need:

- Coding experience (visual builder handles 80% of the work)
- A development team
- Months of time
- Thousands of dollars

Time commitment:

- ~3-5 hours per day
- Spread across 5-7 days
- Flexible schedule (work at your own pace)

Let's begin.

## Day 1: Database Design

### Understanding Your Data Model

Before building any interface, you need to design your database. This is the foundation everything else builds on.

A typical CRM has four core entities:

1. Companies (Organizations you do business with)
1. Contacts (People at those companies)
1. Deals (Sales opportunities)
1. Activities (Calls, meetings, emails, notes)

### Step 1: Create Your Companies Table

Open the AlgorithmShift database designer (Visual → Database → Add Table).

Companies table:

```
Table: companies
Fields:
  - id (UUID, primary key, auto-generated)
  - name (Text, required, max 200 chars)
  - domain (Text, unique) // e.g., "acme.com"
  - industry (Select: Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Retail, Other)
  - size (Select: 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-1000, 1000+)
  - address (Text)
  - city (Text)
  - state (Text)
  - country (Text)
  - phone (Phone number format)
  - website (URL)
  - created_at (Timestamp, auto-set)
  - updated_at (Timestamp, auto-update)
  - owner_id (Reference to users table)

```

Why these fields?

- domain lets you auto-enrich data from external sources
- owner_id implements ownership (important for security later)
- Size and industry enable segmentation for reporting

### Step 2: Create Your Contacts Table

Contacts table:

```
Table: contacts
Fields:
  - id (UUID, primary key)
  - company_id (Reference to companies, on delete: set null)
  - first_name (Text, required)
  - last_name (Text, required)
  - full_name (Computed: first_name + ' ' + last_name)
  - email (Email, unique)
  - phone (Phone)
  - mobile (Phone)
  - title (Text) // Job title
  - department (Select: Sales, Marketing, Engineering, HR, Other)
  - is_primary (Boolean, default: false)
  - linkedin_url (URL)
  - notes (Long text)
  - created_at (Timestamp)
  - updated_at (Timestamp)
  - owner_id (Reference to users)

```

Relationship:

- Many contacts can belong to one company
- Foreign key: company_id → companies.id

### Step 3: Create Your Deals Table

Deals table:

```
Table: deals
Fields:
  - id (UUID)
  - company_id (Reference to companies, required)
  - contact_id (Reference to contacts, optional)
  - title (Text, required)
  - amount (Currency, USD)
  - stage (Select: Prospecting, Qualification, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won, Closed Lost)
  - probability (Number, 0-100, based on stage)
  - expected_close_date (Date)
  - actual_close_date (Date)
  - source (Select: Website, Referral, Cold Call, Event, Other)
  - priority (Select: Low, Medium, High)
  - notes (Long text)
  - created_at (Timestamp)
  - updated_at (Timestamp)
  - owner_id (Reference to users, required)

```

Relationship:

- Each deal belongs to one company
- Each deal optionally has a primary contact
- Each deal has an owner (sales rep responsible)

### Step 4: Create Your Activities Table

Activities table:

```
Table: activities
Fields:
  - id (UUID)
  - type (Select: Call, Email, Meeting, Note, Task)
  - subject (Text, required)
  - description (Long text)
  - due_date (Datetime)
  - completed (Boolean, default: false)
  - completed_at (Timestamp)
  - company_id (Reference to companies)
  - contact_id (Reference to contacts)
  - deal_id (Reference to deals)
  - created_by (Reference to users)
  - assigned_to (Reference to users)
  - created_at (Timestamp)
  - updated_at (Timestamp)

```

Why this design?

- Activities can relate to companies, contacts, or deals (flexible)
- assigned_to enables task delegation
- completed flag for task tracking

### Step 5: Add Validation Rules

Set up validation to keep data clean:

Companies:

- Name must be unique
- Domain format: lowercase, no spaces
- Phone format: E.164 international standard

Contacts:

- Email must be valid format
- At least first_name OR last_name required

Deals:

- Amount must be ≥ 0
- Expected close date must be in the future
- Probability auto-updates based on stage:

Prospecting: 10%
Qualification: 25%
Proposal: 50%
Negotiation: 75%
Closed Won: 100%
Closed Lost: 0%

### Step 6: Create Database Indexes

For performance, add indexes on frequently queried fields:

```
CREATE INDEX idx_companies_owner ON companies(owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_companies_domain ON companies(domain);
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_company ON contacts(company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_email ON contacts(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_deals_company ON deals(company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_deals_stage ON deals(stage);
CREATE INDEX idx_deals_owner ON deals(owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_activities_due_date ON activities(due_date, completed);

```

Generated automatically by AlgorithmShift's visual designer when you set fields as "indexed."

### What You've Accomplished

✅ Complete database schema
✅ Relationships between tables
✅ Validation rules
✅ Performance indexes
✅ Automatic REST and GraphQL APIs for all tables

Auto-generated API endpoints (yes, really):

- GET /api/companies - List companies
- POST /api/companies - Create company
- GET /api/companies/:id - Get one company
- PATCH /api/companies/:id - Update company
- DELETE /api/companies/:id - Delete company
- (Same for contacts, deals, activities)

## Day 2: Build the User Interface

Now comes the fun part: building the visual interface. No coding required for this section.

### Step 1: Create the Companies List View

Open Visual Builder → Add Page → "Companies"

Drag and drop components:

1. Page Header

Title: "Companies"
Add button: "+ New Company"
1. Search & Filter Bar

Search field (searches: name, domain)
Industry filter (dropdown)
Size filter (dropdown)
Owner filter (dropdown)
1. Data Table Component

Data source: companies table
Columns:

Company Name (link to detail page)
Industry (badge with color coding)
Size
Website (clickable link)
Owner (user avatar + name)
Created (relative date: "2 days ago")

Enable: sorting, pagination (25 per page)
Enable: bulk actions (delete, change owner)

Configuration (no code):

```
Data Source: companies
Sort: updated_at DESC
Filters: {
  industry: filterState.industry,
  size: filterState.size,
  owner_id: filterState.owner
}
Search: {
  fields: ['name', 'domain'],
  query: searchState.query
}

```

### Step 2: Create the Company Detail Page

Page layout:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ← Back to Companies                │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Company Name]           [Edit]    │
│  Industry Badge | Size | Created    │
├──────────────┬──────────────────────┤
│              │                      │
│  Details     │  Related Contacts    │
│  Card        │  (Table)             │
│              │                      │
│              ├──────────────────────┤
│              │  Related Deals       │
│              │  (Kanban or List)    │
│              │                      │
│              ├──────────────────────┤
│              │  Activity Timeline   │
│              │  (Feed)              │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────┘

```

Left Column: Details Card

- Company name
- Industry, size, website
- Address (formatted)
- Phone
- Owner (with avatar)
- Edit button (opens modal form)

Right Column: Tabs

Tab 1: Contacts (related)

- Mini table showing contacts at this company
- Columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone
- "+ Add Contact" button

Tab 2: Deals (related)

- Kanban board showing deals by stage
- Or table view toggle
- Deal cards show: title, amount, close date
- "+ New Deal" button

Tab 3: Activity Timeline

- Reverse chronological feed
- Icons for each activity type (call, email, meeting)
- "Log Activity" button

### Step 3: Build the Deal Pipeline (Kanban)

This is the centerpiece of your CRM.

Add Page → "Deals Pipeline"

Drag Kanban Board component:

```
Data source: deals
Group by: stage
Columns:
  - Prospecting
  - Qualification
  - Proposal
  - Negotiation
  - Closed Won
  - Closed Lost

Card displays:
  - Deal title
  - Company name
  - Amount ($XX,XXX)
  - Expected close date
  - Owner avatar
  - Priority indicator (color)

Enable drag-and-drop between columns
On drop → update deal.stage

```

Top filters:

- Owner filter (dropdown: Me, My Team, All)
- Date range (This Month, This Quarter, This Year)
- Amount range (slider)

Summary row (above columns):

- Column name
- Number of deals
- Total value
- Weighted value (amount × probability)

### Step 4: Create Forms

You need forms for creating/editing records.

Company Form:

```
Fields (left-right, two columns):
  Left:
    - Company Name*
    - Industry*
    - Size
    - Website
  Right:
    - Address
    - City, State
    - Country
    - Phone

Validation:
  - Name required
  - Industry required
  - Valid URL for website
  - Valid phone format

Actions:
  - Save (creates/updates company)
  - Cancel (closes modal)

```

Contact Form, Deal Form: Similar layout.

Pro tip: Forms auto-generate based on your table schema. Just customize the layout.

### Step 5: Build the Dashboard

Add Page → "Dashboard"

Grid layout:

```
┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│  Revenue │  Deals   │  Conver- │
│  This    │  Closing │  sion    │
│  Month   │  Soon    │  Rate    │
├──────────┴──────────┴──────────┤
│                                │
│  Revenue by Month (Chart)      │
│                                │
├─────────────┬──────────────────┤
│  Deals by   │  Top 10          │
│  Stage      │  Companies       │
│  (Pie)      │  (Table)         │
└─────────────┴──────────────────┘

```

Drag Chart components:

1. Stat Cards (top row):

Query: SUM(amount) WHERE stage = 'Closed Won' AND month = current
Format as currency
Show trend vs. last month
1. Revenue by Month (Line Chart):

X-axis: Months
Y-axis: Revenue
Query: SELECT month, SUM(amount) FROM deals WHERE stage = 'Closed Won' GROUP BY month
1. Deals by Stage (Pie Chart):

Query: SELECT stage, COUNT(*) FROM deals WHERE stage NOT IN ('Closed Won', 'Closed Lost') GROUP BY stage
1. Top Companies (Table):

Query: SELECT company, SUM(amount) FROM deals GROUP BY company ORDER BY sum DESC LIMIT 10

No SQL? No problem.
The visual query builder lets you construct these queries by clicking. The system generates optimized SQL automatically.

### What You've Accomplished

✅ Companies list and detail pages
✅ Deal pipeline Kanban board
✅ Forms for creating/editing data
✅ Analytics dashboard
✅ Responsive design (works on mobile browsers)

All without writing code. The visual builder generated React components behind the scenes.

## Day 3: Workflow Automation

Automation is what turns a database into a living CRM.

### Step 1: Deal Stage Change Automation

Workflow: "Notify on Deal Stage Change"

Open Workflows → Create New

Trigger: Deal record updated
Condition: deal.stage changed

Actions:

1. Send Email to Deal Owner

```
To: {{ deal.owner.email }}
Subject: Deal "{{ deal.title }}" moved to {{ deal.stage }}
Body: 
  Hi {{ deal.owner.first_name }},

  The deal "{{ deal.title }}" with {{ deal.company.name }} 
  has been moved to {{ deal.stage }}.

  Amount: {{ deal.amount | currency }}
  Expected close: {{ deal.expected_close_date | date }}

  View deal: {{ deal.url }}

```

1. Send Slack Notification (if stage = "Closed Won")

```
Channel: #sales-wins
Message: 
  🎉 {{ deal.owner.name }} just closed a deal!
  Company: {{ deal.company.name }}
  Amount: {{ deal.amount | currency }}

```

1. Create Activity

```
Type: Note
Subject: Stage changed to {{ deal.stage }}
Description: Deal moved from {{ deal.previous_stage }} to {{ deal.stage }} by {{ user.name }}
Related to: this deal

```

### Step 2: Auto-Assign Deals Based on Territory

Workflow: "Auto-Assign Deals by Territory"

Trigger: New deal created

Condition: deal.owner_id is empty

Action: Run JavaScript

```
// Get company state
const state = deal.company.state;

// Territory mapping
const territories = {
  'CA': 'user_id_west_rep',
  'NY': 'user_id_east_rep',
  'TX': 'user_id_south_rep',
  // ... more states
};

// Assign owner
deal.owner_id = territories[state] || 'user_id_default_rep';

// Save
await deal.save();

// Send notification to assigned owner
await sendEmail({
  to: deal.owner.email,
  subject: `New deal assigned: ${deal.title}`,
  body: `You've been assigned a new deal in ${state}.`
});

```

### Step 3: Weekly Digest Email

Workflow: "Weekly Sales Digest"

Trigger: Scheduled (every Monday at 9am)

Action: Send Email to All Sales Reps

```
// Query this week's stats
const stats = await db.query(`
  SELECT 
    owner_id,
    COUNT(*) as deals_count,
    SUM(amount) as total_value,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN stage = 'Closed Won' THEN 1 END) as wins
  FROM deals
  WHERE updated_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  GROUP BY owner_id
`);

// Send personalized email to each rep
for (const stat of stats) {
  await sendEmail({
    to: stat.owner.email,
    subject: 'Your Weekly Sales Summary',
    body: renderTemplate('weekly-digest', {
      deals: stat.deals_count,
      value: stat.total_value,
      wins: stat.wins,
      upcoming: stat.closing_soon
    })
  });
}

```

### Step 4: Deal Reminder Workflow

Workflow: "Deal Close Date Reminders"

Trigger: Scheduled (daily at 8am)

Action:

```
// Find deals closing in next 7 days
const upcomingDeals = await db.deals.find({
  expected_close_date: {
    gte: new Date(),
    lte: addDays(new Date(), 7)
  },
  stage: { notIn: ['Closed Won', 'Closed Lost'] }
});

// Group by owner
const byOwner = groupBy(upcomingDeals, 'owner_id');

// Send summary to each owner
for (const [ownerId, deals] of Object.entries(byOwner)) {
  await sendEmail({
    to: deals[0].owner.email,
    subject: `${deals.length} deals closing this week`,
    body: renderDealList(deals)
  });
}

```

### What You've Accomplished

✅ Automatic email notifications
✅ Territory-based deal assignment
✅ Weekly digest emails
✅ Reminder workflows
✅ Slack/Teams integrations

## Day 4: Build Native Mobile Apps

This is where things get really cool. You're going to build iOS and Android apps from the same codebase.

### Step 1: Configure Mobile App

Navigate to: Mobile → New App

App Configuration:

```
App Name: Your CRM
Bundle ID: com.yourcompany.crm
Primary Color: #3b82f6
Icon: Upload (1024×1024 PNG)

Platforms:
  ☑ iOS
  ☑ Android

Build Mode: Expo (managed)

```

### Step 2: Design Mobile Navigation

Bottom Tab Navigation:

- 🏠 Home (dashboard)
- 📊 Deals (pipeline)
- 👥 Contacts (list)
- ➕ Quick Add (modal)
- 👤 Profile

### Step 3: Mobile Home Screen

Dashboard (optimized for mobile):

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│  Good morning, Alex  │
│                      │
│  ┌────────┬────────┐ │
│  │ Active │ Close  │ │
│  │ Deals  │ Rate   │ │
│  │   12   │  45%   │ │
│  └────────┴────────┘ │
│                      │
│  Deals Closing Soon  │
│  ┌────────────────┐  │
│  │ Acme Corp      │  │

│  Recent Activity     │
│  • Call with John... │
│  • Proposal sent ... │
└──────────────────────┘

```

### Step 4: Mobile Deals Pipeline

Swipeable Kanban:

- Horizontal scroll through stages
- Card design optimized for touch
- Swipe actions: Edit, Delete, Call Contact

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│ Prospecting      (8) │
│  ← swipe to change → │
│                      │
│ ┌────────────────┐   │
│ │ Acme Corp      │   │
│ │ $50,000        │   │
│ │ Close: Dec 15  │   │
│ │ [Call][Email]  │   │
│ └────────────────┘   │
│ ┌────────────────┐   │
│ │ TechStart Inc  │   │
│ │ $25,000        │   │
│ │ Close: Dec 20  │   │
│ │ [Call][Email]  │   │
│ └────────────────┘   │
└──────────────────────┘

```

### Step 5: Offline Mode

Configure offline sync:

```
// Automatically syncs when online
offlineConfig: {
  tables: ['companies', 'contacts', 'deals', 'activities'],
  syncInterval: 300000, // 5 minutes
  conflictResolution: 'lastWriteWins',
  maxOfflineTime: 86400000 // 24 hours
}

```

Offline-first architecture:

- All data cached locally in SQLite
- Changes queued when offline
- Auto-sync when connection restored
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

### Step 6: Push Notifications

Configure notifications:

1. Deal assigned to you:

Title: "New Deal Assigned"
Body: "{{ deal.title }} at {{ company.name }}"
Deep link: Open deal detail
1. Deal closing soon:

Title: "Deal Closing in 3 Days"
Body: "{{ deal.title }} - {{ deal.amount | currency }}"
Deep link: Open deal
1. Activity reminder:

Title: "Upcoming: {{ activity.subject }}"
Body: "{{ activity.type }} at {{ activity.due_time }}"
Action buttons: [Complete] [Snooze]

### Step 7: Device Integrations

Business Card Scanner:

```
// Using device camera + OCR
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';
import { parseBusinessCard } from '@/lib/ocr';

async function scanBusinessCard() {
  const photo = await Camera.takePictureAsync();
  const data = await parseBusinessCard(photo.uri);
  
  // Pre-fill contact form
  contactForm.setValue({
    name: data.name,
    title: data.title,
    company: data.company,
    email: data.email,
    phone: data.phone
  });
}

```

Click-to-Call:

```
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

function callContact(phone) {
  Linking.openURL(`tel:${phone}`);
  
  // Log activity
  createActivity({
    type: 'call',
    contact_id: contact.id,
    subject: `Called ${contact.name}`
  });
}

```

GPS Check-In:

```
import * as Location from 'expo-location';

async function checkInAtCompany(companyId) {
  const location = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync();
  
  createActivity({
    type: 'meeting',
    company_id: companyId,
    subject: 'On-site visit',
    location: {
      lat: location.coords.latitude,
      lng: location.coords.longitude
    }
  });
}

```

### Step 8: Build & Deploy

Click: Mobile → Build

## Day 5: AI-Powered Features

Let's add AI to make your CRM truly intelligent.

### Step 1: Configure AI Agent

Navigate to: AI → New Agent

Agent Configuration:

```
Name: CRM Assistant
Model: GPT-4 (or Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
Temperature: 0.7
Max Tokens: 2000

System Prompt:
  You are a helpful CRM assistant. You have access to companies, 
  contacts, deals, and activities data. Help users find information, 
  create records, and get insights from their CRM data.
  
  Always be concise and professional. When creating records, confirm 
  the details before saving.

```

### Step 2: Give the Agent Tools

Available Tools:

1. Search Companies

```
tool: searchCompanies
description: Search for companies by name, industry, or size
parameters:
  - query (string): Search term
  - industry (string, optional)
  - size (string, optional)
returns: List of matching companies

```

1. Search Contacts
1. Search Deals
1. Create Contact
1. Create Deal
1. Get Deal Summary
1. Log Activity

### Step 3: Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Connect agent to your CRM data:

```
// Vector embeddings for semantic search
rag: {
  enabled: true,
  sources: [
    { table: 'companies', fields: ['name', 'industry', 'notes'] },
    { table: 'contacts', fields: ['full_name', 'title', 'notes'] },
    { table: 'deals', fields: ['title', 'notes'] },
    { table: 'activities', fields: ['subject', 'description'] }
  ],
  vectorDB: 'pinecone', // or built-in
  updateFrequency: 'realtime'
}

```

Now your agent can answer questions like:

- "Show me all deals with tech companies over $50K"
- "Who is the contact at Acme Corp?"
- "What deals are closing this month?"
- "Create a new contact at TechStart Inc"

### Step 4: Email Draft Generation

Workflow integration:

```
User clicks: "Compose Email" on contact
AI generates personalized email based on:
  - Contact relationship history
  - Recent deals/activities
  - Company context
  - Email purpose (selected by user)

Example:
  Purpose: Follow-up after demo
  
  Generated:
    Hi Sarah,
    
    Thanks for taking the time to see our demo yesterday. Based on our 
    conversation about your team's workflow challenges, I think our 
    automation features would be particularly valuable.
    
    I've attached a case study from a similar company in the healthcare 
    space that saw a 40% reduction in manual data entry.
    
    Would next Tuesday work for a follow-up call to discuss implementation?
    
    Best,
    [Your name]

```

User can edit before sending.

### Step 5: Meeting Summary Creation

After sales calls:

```
Upload call recording or paste transcript
AI generates:
  - Summary of key points
  - Action items
  - Next steps
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Recommended deal stage

Auto-creates:
  - Activity record with summary
  - Tasks for action items
  - Deal update if needed

```

### Step 6: Intelligent Data Entry

Smart contact creation:

```
User: "Add John Smith, VP of Sales at Acme Corp, john@acme.com"

AI:
  - Parses: name, title, company, email
  - Checks if Acme Corp exists (finds it)
  - Checks if john@acme.com exists (doesn't)
  - Pre-fills form:
      First Name: John
      Last Name: Smith
      Title: VP of Sales
      Company: Acme Corp (linked)
      Email: john@acme.com
  - Asks: "Does this look correct?"
  - User confirms
  - Creates contact

```

### Step 7: Chat Interface

Add AI chat widget to your CRM:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 💬 CRM Assistant        │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ You: Show me my deals   │
│ closing this week       │
│                         │
│ AI: You have 3 deals    │
│ closing this week:      │
│                         │
│ 1. Acme Corp - $50K     │
│    Close: Dec 15        │
│    Stage: Negotiation   │
│                         │
│ 2. TechStart - $25K     │
│    Close: Dec 17        │
│    Stage: Proposal      │
│                         │
│ 3. Global Inc - $100K   │
│    Close: Dec 19        │
│    Stage: Proposal      │
│                         │
│ Would you like me to    │
│ create reminder tasks?  │
└─────────────────────────┘

```

Works in:

- Web app (sidebar)
- Mobile app (chat screen)
- Slack (bot)

### What You've Accomplished

✅ AI chatbot with CRM knowledge
✅ Email draft generation
✅ Meeting summary creation
✅ Intelligent data entry
✅ Natural language queries
✅ RAG integration with your data

## Day 6: Security & Permissions

Now let's lock down your CRM with enterprise-grade security.

### Step 1: Row-Level Security (RLS)

Concept: Users only see records they own or have been shared with.

Enable RLS on tables:

```
-- Deals table
CREATE POLICY "users_see_own_deals" ON deals
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    owner_id = current_user_id()
    OR
    id IN (
      SELECT deal_id FROM deal_shares WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
    )
  );

-- Companies, Contacts, Activities: Similar policies

```

Visual configuration (no SQL):

```
Table: deals
RLS Policy: "Own or Shared"
  SELECT: owner_id = current_user OR deal_shares.user_id = current_user
  INSERT: Always allow
  UPDATE: owner_id = current_user OR deal_shares.permission = 'edit'
  DELETE: owner_id = current_user

```

### Step 2: Role-Based Access Control

Create roles:

1. Sales Rep

Can create/edit own deals, contacts, companies
Can view team members' deals (read-only)
Cannot delete anything
Cannot access admin settings
1. Sales Manager

Can view/edit all team deals
Can reassign deals
Can run reports
Cannot access billing
1. Admin

Full access to everything
Can manage users
Can configure workflows
Can export data

### Step 3: Field-Level Security

Hide sensitive fields from certain roles:

```
Table: deals
Field: amount

Permissions:
  - Sales Rep: Can see only their own deal amounts
  - Sales Manager: Can see all amounts
  - Admin: Can see all amounts

Table: contacts
Field: notes

Permissions:
  - Owner: Full access
  - Others: Can see, cannot edit

```

### Step 4: OAuth / SAML SSO

Configure single sign-on:

```
Auth Methods:
  ☑ Email/Password
  ☑ Google OAuth
  ☑ Microsoft OAuth
  ☑ SAML 2.0 (for enterprise)

SAML Configuration:
  Entity ID: https://yourcompany.com
  ACS URL: https://api.algorithmshift.ai/auth/saml/acs
  Certificate: [Upload]
  
  Attribute Mapping:
    email → email
    firstName → first_name
    lastName → last_name
    role → role

```

### Step 5: Audit Logging

Track all data changes:

```
auditLog: {
  enabled: true,
  events: [
    'record.created',
    'record.updated',
    'record.deleted',
    'user.login',
    'user.logout',
    'permission.changed',
    'export.completed'
  ],
  retention: 365, // days
  includeFieldChanges: true
}

```

Audit log entry example:

```
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-23T10:30:00Z",
  "user": "alex@company.com",
  "action": "record.updated",
  "table": "deals",
  "record_id": "deal_123",
  "changes": {
    "stage": {
      "from": "Proposal",
      "to": "Negotiation"
    },
    "amount": {
      "from": 45000,
      "to": 50000
    }
  },
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1"
}

```

### Step 6: Data Export Controls

Prevent unauthorized data extraction:

```
Export Permissions:
  - Sales Rep: Cannot bulk export
  - Sales Manager: Can export own team data
  - Admin: Can export all data
  
Rate Limits:
  - Max 1,000 records per export
  - Max 5 exports per day
  - Exports logged in audit trail
  
Watermarking:
  - PDF exports include user email watermark
  - CSV exports include export metadata

```

### What You've Accomplished

✅ Row-level security
✅ Role-based access control
✅ Field-level permissions
✅ OAuth/SAML SSO
✅ Comprehensive audit logging
✅ Data export controls

## Day 7: Polish, Test & Deploy

- 💰 Cost: $50,000-500,000
- 👥 Team: Implementation consultants, admins
- 🔒 Ownership: Zero
- 📱 Mobile: Limited/poor quality
- 🤖 AI: Locked to vendor's AI
- ⚖️ Flexibility: Constrained to platform

Your Custom CRM:

- ⏰ Time: 1 week
- 💰 Cost: $299/month (or $0 with free tier)
- 👥 Team: You (with visual tools + AI)
- 🔒 Ownership: 100% source code
- 📱 Mobile: Native iOS/Android
- 🤖 AI: Choose any LLM
- ⚖️ Flexibility: Build anything

## What's Next?

Your CRM is live, but this is just the beginning.

Week 2 and beyond:

- Add more features (forecasting, territories, quotas)
- Integrate with email (Gmail, Outlook)
- Connect to marketing tools
- Build customer portal
- Create sales playbooks
- Add AI sales coaching
- White-label for clients

The beauty: You can keep building. You own it.

## Final Thoughts

You just did something most companies think is impossible: built a production-ready CRM in one week.

Not a prototype. Not a demo. A real, working application with:

- Web and mobile interfaces
- Automation
- AI capabilities
- Enterprise security
- Source code you own

Traditional software vendors don't want you to know this is possible. They profit from the myth that custom software takes months and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

But you've proven it's not true.

The question now is: What else will you build?

**Description:** Query your data with GraphQL. Flexible queries and precise data fetching.

---

GraphQL API - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationAPI Reference
# GraphQL API

Query your workspace data with GraphQL. Request exactly what you need with a single query.

### GraphQL Support

GraphQL support is coming soon to AlgorithmShift. Currently, we recommend using our powerful REST API with field selection and foreign key expansion for similar capabilities.

## GraphQL Endpoint (Coming Soon)
Copy
```
# GraphQL endpoint (planned)
https://api.algorithmshift.ai/graphql/{workspace}

# Example query
query GetTasks {
  tasks(where: { status: "active" }, limit: 10) {
    id
    title
    status
    assignedUser {
      name
      email
    }
    project {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Alternative: REST API with Expansion

You can achieve similar results with our REST API:
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?status=active&limit=10&expand=assignedUser,project&fields=id,title,status

// Returns
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "task-1",
      "title": "Complete feature",
      "status": "active",
      "assignedUser": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
      },
      "project": {
        "name": "Platform Development"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# API Authentication - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShift

**URL:** https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/api/auth

**Description:** Authenticate API requests with API keys. Generate, manage, and secure your keys.

---

API Authentication - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationAPI Reference
# API Authentication

Authenticate API requests using API keys. Secure, manageable, and traceable access to your workspace.

## Authentication Methods

### API Keys (Recommended)
Copy
```
Authorization: Bearer as_1234567890abcdef...

# Example request
curl -X GET \
  https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1/tables/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer as_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Session-Based

For browser-based apps, use session cookies (automatically handled by NextAuth).
Copy
```
// Cookies set automatically
Cookie: next-auth.session-token=...
```

## Generating API Keys
1
### Navigate to API Keys

Go to Access Control → API Security → API Keys
2
### Create API Key

Key Name

Production API Key

User

Select workspace_admin user

Expiration

90 days (recommended)
3
### Copy and Store Securely

Important!

API keys are only shown once. Store them securely in environment variables or secrets manager.

## Security Best Practices

Store API keys in environment variables, never in code

Use different keys for development and production

Set expiration dates on all API keys

Rotate keys every 90 days

Revoke unused or compromised keys immediately

Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity

Never commit keys to version control

Use secrets manager for production keys

# Row-Level Security (RLS) - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShift

**URL:** https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/auth/rls

**Description:** Implement row-level security to control data access at the database level. Secure your data with RLS policies.

---

Row-Level Security (RLS) - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationAuthentication
# Row-Level Security (RLS)

Control data access at the row level. Ensure users can only see and modify data they're authorized to access. Enforced at the database level for maximum security.

### Database-Level

Can't be bypassed

### Automatic

No code changes needed

### Flexible

User, group, role-based

### Performant

PostgreSQL optimized

## How RLS Works

### RLS Overview

Row-Level Security policies are enforced at the PostgreSQL database level. When a user queries a table, the RLS policy automatically filters results based on the policy conditions.
Copy
```
-- User queries: SELECT * FROM tasks

-- PostgreSQL automatically applies RLS:
SELECT * FROM tasks 
WHERE user_id = current_user_id()

-- User only sees their own tasks!
```

## Common RLS Patterns

### Owner-Based Access

Users can only access records they created

#### Policy Configuration
Copy
```
{
  "table": "tasks",
  "policyName": "owner_access",
  "operation": "SELECT",
  "condition": "created_by = {{ current_user.id }}"
}
```

#### Generated SQL
Copy
```
CREATE POLICY owner_access 
ON tasks
FOR SELECT
USING (created_by = current_user_id());
```

Users can only SELECT rows where they are the creator.

### Group-Based Access

Users can access records belonging to their group
Copy
```
{
  "table": "projects",
  "policyName": "group_access",
  "operation": "ALL",
  "condition": "group_id IN (SELECT group_id FROM user_groups WHERE user_id = {{ current_user.id }})"
}

-- Users can access projects from any group they belong to
```

### Role-Based Access

Different access based on user role
Copy
```
{
  "table": "customers",
  "policyName": "role_based_access",
  "operation": "SELECT",
  "condition": `CASE
    WHEN {{ current_user.role }} = 'admin' THEN true
    WHEN {{ current_user.role }} = 'manager' THEN department_id = {{ current_user.department_id }}
    ELSE assigned_to = {{ current_user.id }}
  END`
}

-- Admins: See all customers
-- Managers: See customers in their department
-- Others: See only assigned customers
```

### Hierarchical Access

Access based on organizational hierarchy
Copy
```
{
  "table": "employees",
  "policyName": "hierarchy_access",
  "operation": "SELECT",
  "condition": `id = {{ current_user.id }} 
  OR manager_id = {{ current_user.id }}
  OR id IN (
    SELECT e.id FROM employees e
    WHERE e.manager_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM employees WHERE manager_id = {{ current_user.id }}
    )
  )`
}

-- Users can see: themselves, their direct reports, 
-- and their reports' reports
```

## Enabling RLS
1
### Navigate to Table Settings

Go to Access Control → Data Management → Tables, select your table, and click "Enable RLS"
2
### Create Policy

Click "Add Policy" and configure:

Policy Name

user_can_read_own_tasks

Operation

SELECT (or ALL, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

Condition

user_id = {{ current_user.id }}
3
### Test the Policy

Query the table and verify users only see authorized data:
Copy
```
// User A queries tasks
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks

// Returns only tasks where user_id = User A's ID
{
  "data": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "My task", "user_id": "user-a" }
    // Other users' tasks NOT included
  ]
}
```

### Important Security Notes

- RLS is enforced at the database level - it cannot be bypassed through the API
- Always test RLS policies thoroughly before production
- Use workspace_admin role to bypass RLS for administration
- Monitor RLS performance on large tables

## Advanced RLS Patterns

### Time-Based Access
Copy
```
{
  "table": "subscriptions",
  "condition": "valid_from <= NOW() AND valid_until >= NOW()"
}

-- Users can only access active subscriptions within the valid period
```

### Shared Records
Copy
```
{
  "table": "documents",
  "condition": `
    owner_id = {{ current_user.id }}
    OR id IN (
      SELECT document_id 
      FROM document_shares 
      WHERE shared_with_user_id = {{ current_user.id }}
    )
  `
}

-- Users can access documents they own OR that are shared with them
```

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
Copy
```
{
  "table": "all_tables",
  "condition": "tenant_id = {{ current_user.tenant_id }}"
}

-- Ensures complete data isolation between tenants
-- Critical for SaaS applications
```

## RLS Functions

Use built-in RLS functions in your policies:
FunctionReturnsDescription`current_user_id()`UUIDCurrent authenticated user ID`current_user_role()`VARCHARUser's primary role`user_groups()`UUID[]Array of user's group IDs`has_permission(perm)`BOOLEANCheck if user has permission`is_admin()`BOOLEANCheck if workspace admin

// Identity Provider Configuration
{
  "idpEntityId": "https://idp.example.com",
  "idpSsoUrl": "https://idp.example.com/sso",
  "idpCertificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----..."
}
```

## Access Control Structure

AlgorithmShift uses a comprehensive access control system:
Copy
```
Identity Layer
├── Users (individual accounts)
├── Groups (organizational units)
│   ├── Departments
│   ├── Teams
│   └── Hierarchies (parent-child)
└── User Types (custom categories)

Authorization Layer
├── Roles (collections of permissions)
│   └── workspace_admin, workspace_user, custom_role
├── Permissions (granular access rights)
│   └── resource.action (e.g., tasks.create, users.read)
└── Record Bindings (row-level security)
    └── Principal-based data access

API Security
├── API Keys (programmatic access)
└── API Resources (endpoint protection)
```

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Control access with roles and permissions:

### Creating Roles

#### Built-in Roles

workspace_admin

Full access to workspace

workspace_user

Limited access

#### Custom Role Example
Copy
```
// Create custom role
{
  "name": "Project Manager",
  "description": "Manage projects and tasks",
  "permissions": [
    "projects.read",
    "projects.create",
    "projects.update",
    "tasks.read",
    "tasks.create",
    "tasks.update",
    "tasks.assign",
    "users.read"
  ]
}
```

### Permission Model

Permissions follow the format: resource.action
ResourceActionsExample`tasks`read, create, update, delete`tasks.create``users`read, create, update, delete`users.read``projects`read, create, update, delete, manage`projects.manage``reports`read, create, export`reports.export`
## Row-Level Security (RLS)

Control data access at the row level:

### What is RLS?

Row-Level Security ensures users can only access data they're authorized to see. It's enforced at the database level, making it impossible to bypass.
Copy
```
// Example: Users can only see their own tasks
{
  "table": "tasks",
  "policy": "user_access",
  "condition": "user_id = {{ current_user.id }}"
}

// Example: Managers can see their team's tasks
{
  "table": "tasks",
  "policy": "manager_access",
  "condition": "user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM team_members WHERE manager_id = {{ current_user.id }})"
}
```

### RLS Policies

Owner-based Access

Users can only access records they created
Copy
```
created_by = {{ current_user.id }}
```

Group-based Access

Users can access records belonging to their group
Copy
```
group_id IN (SELECT group_id FROM user_groups WHERE user_id = {{ current_user.id }})
```

Role-based Access

Different access based on user role
Copy
```
CASE
  WHEN {{ current_user.role }} = 'admin' THEN true
  WHEN {{ current_user.role }} = 'manager' THEN department_id = {{ current_user.department_id }}
  ELSE user_id = {{ current_user.id }}
END
```

## API Keys

Generate API keys for programmatic access:

### Creating API Keys

#### Key Properties
Format`as_[64-char-hex]`User`workspace_admin`Expiration`Optional`Permissions`Inherited from user`
#### Using API Keys
Copy
```
// In HTTP requests
curl -X GET \
  https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1/tables/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer as_1234..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

// In JavaScript
fetch('/api/v1/tables/tasks', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
```

### Security Best Practices

- Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- Set expiration dates on API keys
- Use different keys for development and production
- Rotate keys regularly
- Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity

## Mobile App Preview

Test your mobile app in real-time with two preview modes: Canvas Preview (instant, in-browser) and QR Code Preview (on your actual device).

### Canvas Preview (React Native Web)

Live preview directly in the builder canvas using React Native Web. See changes instantly as you drag and drop components.

- Instant updates (no build step)
- Mobile viewport simulation
- Great for rapid iteration

### QR Code Preview (Real Device)

Scan a QR code to test your app on your actual phone/tablet. Powered by Expo and Fargate for production-grade preview.

- Test on iOS and Android
- True native performance
- Device-specific testing (gestures, sensors)
[Learn About Mobile Preview →](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/mobile/preview)

# Forms & Validation

Build powerful forms with built-in validation, error handling, and data submission. Connect directly to your database or APIs with zero configuration.

### Text Input

### Select
Choose option...
### Checkbox
I agree
### Textarea

## Creating a Form
1
### Add Form Components

Drag form components onto your canvas:

Text Input

Name, email, etc.

Select

Dropdowns

Checkbox

Boolean options

Date Picker

Date selection

File Upload

File attachments

Submit Button

Form submission
2
### Configure Validation

#### Built-in Validators

Required

Field must have value

Email

Valid email format

Min/Max Length

Character limits

Pattern (Regex)

Custom validation

#### Validation Example
Copy
```
// Email input validation
{
  "type": "email",
  "required": true,
  "validation": {
    "pattern": "^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$",
    "message": "Please enter a valid email"
  }
}

// Password validation
{
  "type": "password",
  "required": true,
  "validation": {
    "minLength": 8,
    "pattern": "^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9]).*$",
    "message": "Min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number"
  }
}
```
3
### Handle Form Submission

Configure what happens when the form is submitted:
Copy
```
// Submit button configuration
{
  "onClick": {
    "type": "form_submit",
    "action": "create_record",
    "table": "contacts",
    "onSuccess": {
      "message": "Contact created successfully!",
      "redirect": "/contacts",
      "resetForm": true
    },
    "onError": {
      "message": "Failed to create contact",
      "showErrors": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Form Actions

Multiple ways to handle form data:

### Save to Database

Directly insert form data into a table
Copy
```
// Form submit action
{
  "type": "create_record",
  "table": "tasks",
  "data": {
    "title": "{{ form.title }}",
    "description": "{{ form.description }}",
    "status": "{{ form.status }}",
    "priority": "{{ form.priority }}",
    "assigned_to": "{{ currentUser.id }}"
  }
}

// Or use the simplified syntax
{
  "type": "create_record",
  "table": "tasks",
  "data": "{{ formData }}"  // Auto-maps all fields
}
```

### Call API

Submit to custom API endpoint
Copy
```
{
  "type": "api_call",
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/contacts",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{ secrets.API_KEY }}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "name": "{{ form.name }}",
    "email": "{{ form.email }}",
    "message": "{{ form.message }}"
  },
  "onSuccess": {
    "message": "Message sent!",
    "resetForm": true
  }
}
```

### Trigger Workflow

Start a workflow with form data
Copy
```
{
  "type": "trigger_workflow",
  "workflowId": "process-lead",
  "data": {
    "name": "{{ form.name }}",
    "email": "{{ form.email }}",
    "company": "{{ form.company }}",
    "phone": "{{ form.phone }}"
  }
}
```

## Validation Patterns

Common validation scenarios:

### Email Validation
Copy
```
{
  "type": "email",
  "required": true,
  "validation": {
    "pattern": "^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$",
    "message": "Invalid email address"
  }
}
```

### Phone Number
Copy
```
{
  "type": "tel",
  "required": true,
  "validation": {
    "pattern": "^\+?[1-9]\d{1,14}$",
    "message": "Invalid phone number"
  }
}
```

### URL Validation
Copy
```
{
  "type": "url",
  "required": true,
  "validation": {
    "pattern": "^https?://.*",
    "message": "Must be valid URL"
  }
}
```

### Custom Validation
Copy
```
{
  "validation": {
    "custom": "{{ value.length >= 10 }}",
    "message": "Min 10 characters"
  }
}
```

## Complete Form Example

      }
    },
    {
      "id": "email",
      "type": "email",
      "label": "Email Address",
      "placeholder": "john@example.com",

      }
    },
    {
      "id": "phone",
      "type": "tel",
      "label": "Phone Number",
      "placeholder": "+1 (555) 123-4567",

        "maxLength": 500,
        "message": "Message must be 10-500 characters"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "newsletter",
      "type": "checkbox",
      "label": "Subscribe to newsletter",
      "required": false
    }
  ],

        "message": "Something went wrong. Please try again.",
        "showErrors": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Form State Management

Access and manipulate form data:

### Form Data Variables
Copy
```
// Access form field values
{{ form.fieldName }}

// Examples:
{{ form.email }}        // Current email value
{{ form.name }}         // Current name value
{{ form.status }}       // Current status value

// All form data as object
{{ formData }}

// Form state
{{ form.isValid }}      // true if all validations pass
{{ form.isDirty }}      // true if any field changed
{{ form.isSubmitting }} // true during submission
{{ form.errors }}       // Object with validation errors
```

### Conditional Field Display
Copy
```
// Show field based on another field's value
{
  "id": "company_name",
  "type": "text",
  "label": "Company Name",
  "visible": "{{ form.account_type === 'business' }}"
}

// Show field based on checkbox
{
  "id": "shipping_address",
  "type": "textarea",
  "label": "Shipping Address",
  "visible": "{{ form.different_shipping === true }}"
}
```

## File Upload

Handle file uploads in your forms:

#### File Upload Configuration
Copy
```
{
  "id": "avatar",
  "type": "file",
  "label": "Profile Picture",
  "accept": "image/*",
  "maxSize": 5242880,  // 5MB
  "multiple": false,
  "uploadConfig": {
    "bucket": "user-uploads",
    "path": "avatars/{{ currentUser.id }}"
  }
}
```

#### Upload Response
Copy
```
// After upload

  "url": "https://cdn.../avatar.jpg",
  "key": "avatars/user-123/avatar.jpg",
  "size": 1024000,
  "type": "image/jpeg"
}

// Access in form
{{ form.avatar.url }}
```

## Error Handling

Display validation errors to users:

### Field-Level Errors
Email Address *
Please enter a valid email address

### Form-Level Errors

Unable to submit form

- • Email is required
- • Password must be at least 8 characters

## Success Messages

Success!

Your message has been sent successfully. We'll get back to you soon!
Copy
```
// Success configuration
{
  "onSuccess": {
    "type": "toast",
    "variant": "success",
    "message": "Form submitted successfully!",
    "duration": 5000,

# REST APIs - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShift

**URL:** https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/database/rest

**Description:** Auto-generated REST APIs for every database table. Complete CRUD operations with advanced querying.

---

REST APIs - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationDatabase & APIs
# REST APIs

Every table in your workspace automatically gets a full REST API with CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.
`GET`
### List/Read
`POST`
### Create
`PUT`
### Update
`PATCH`
### Partial Update
`DELETE`
### Delete

## Endpoint Structure
Copy
```
# Base URL
https://api.algorithmshift.ai/api/v1

# Table endpoints
/tables/{table_name}           # Collection endpoint
/tables/{table_name}/{id}      # Single resource endpoint

# Entity endpoints (advanced)
/entities/{table_name}         # With complex filtering

# Examples
GET    /api/v1/tables/tasks
POST   /api/v1/tables/tasks
GET    /api/v1/tables/tasks/123
PUT    /api/v1/tables/tasks/123
DELETE /api/v1/tables/tasks/123
```

## Shorthand Filter Operators

AlgorithmShift supports bracket notation for advanced filtering directly in the URL query string. Perfect for REST clients, webhooks, and dynamic filtering.

### Why Shorthand Operators?

Instead of sending a JSON body with complex filter objects, you can use simple URL parameters with bracket notation for common query patterns.
**Standard (verbose):**`POST with {"filter": {"price": {"gte": 100}}}`**Shorthand (simple):**`GET ?price[gte]=100`
### Available Shorthand Operators
OperatorMeaningExample[gte]Greater than or equalprice[gte]=100[lte]Less than or equalprice[lte]=500[gt]Greater thanstock[gt]=0[lt]Less thanpriority[lt]=5[ne]Not equalstatus[ne]=deleted[like]Pattern match (case-insensitive)name[like]=%john%[in]In array (comma-separated)status[in]=active,pending[nin]Not in arrayrole[nin]=admin,superadmin[null]Is null or not nulldeleted_at[null]=true
### Real-World Examples

Date Range (last 30 days):
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/tables/orders?created_at[gte]=2024-01-01&created_at[lte]=2024-01-31
```

Price Range:
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/tables/products?price[gte]=100&price[lte]=500
```

Multiple Statuses:
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?status[in]=pending,in-progress,review
```

Search by Name:
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/tables/customers?name[like]=%smith%
```

Exclude Deleted Records:
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/tables/users?deleted_at[null]=true
```

Combining Multiple Filters:
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/tables/leads?
  status[in]=qualified,contacted&
  score[gte]=70&
  created_at[gte]=2024-01-01&
  source[ne]=spam
```
[Complete Filtering Guide →](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/api/filtering)
## Foreign Key Expansion

Use the expand parameter to fetch related records in a single request, reducing the number of API calls needed.
Copy
```
# Without expansion (2 requests needed)
GET /api/v1/tables/orders/123
{
  "order_id": "123",
  "customer_id": "customer-456",
  "product_id": "product-789"
}

# Then fetch customer separately
GET /api/v1/tables/customers/customer-456

# With expansion (1 request)
GET /api/v1/tables/orders/123?expand=customer_id,product_id
{
  "order_id": "123",
  "customer_id": "customer-456",
  "product_id": "product-789",
  "_expanded": {
    "customer_id": {
      "customer_id": "customer-456",
      "name": "Acme Corp",
      "email": "contact@acme.com"
    },
    "product_id": {
      "product_id": "product-789",
      "name": "Premium Subscription",
      "price": 99.00
    }
  }
}
```

## Complex Filters (JSON Body)

For advanced filtering beyond shorthand operators, use the /entities endpoint with JSON filter objects.

### OR Conditions
Copy
```
POST /api/v1/entities/tasks
{
  "filter": {
    "or": [
      { "status": "urgent" },
      { "priority": { "gte": 8 } }
    ]
  }
}
```

### AND + OR Combination
Copy
```
POST /api/v1/entities/tasks
{
  "filter": {
    "and": [
      { "status": "active" },
      {
        "or": [
          { "assigned_to": "user-123" },
          { "created_by": "user-123" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Aggregations

Perform SQL aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) with grouping and filtering.
Copy
```
POST /api/v1/entities/tasks/aggregate
{
  "groupBy": ["status"],
  "aggregations": {
    "count": "*",
    "avg_priority": { "avg": "priority" },
    "total_hours": { "sum": "estimated_hours" }
  }
}

// Response
{
  "data": [
    {
      "status": "pending",
      "count": 45,
      "avg_priority": 6.2,
      "total_hours": 120
    },
    {
      "status": "completed",
      "count": 78,
      "avg_priority": 5.8,
      "total_hours": 234
    }
  ]
}
```

## Pagination & Sorting

### Pagination
Copy
```
# Limit and offset
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?limit=50&offset=100

# Page-based
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?page=3&pageSize=25
```

### Sorting
Copy
```
# Ascending
GET /api/v1/tables/tasks?sort=created_at

**Description:** Create database views for complex queries. Reusable virtual tables with SQL.

---

Database Views - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationDatabase & APIs
# Database Views

Create reusable virtual tables with SQL queries. Views get their own auto-generated REST APIs.

## What are Views?

Database views are saved SQL queries that act like virtual tables. They're perfect for:

### Use Cases

- Complex JOIN queries
- Aggregated data
- Computed columns
- Simplified data access

### Example View
Copy
```
CREATE VIEW v_customer_orders AS
SELECT 
  c.id as customer_id,
  c.name as customer_name,
  c.email,
  COUNT(o.id) as total_orders,
  SUM(o.total) as lifetime_value,
  MAX(o.created_at) as last_order_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.email;
```

## Creating Views

Navigate to Access Control → Data Management → Views, click "Create View"
Copy
```
{
  "name": "v_active_projects",
  "description": "Active projects with team member count",
  "sql": `
    SELECT 
      p.id,
      p.name,
      p.status,
      COUNT(DISTINCT pm.user_id) as team_size,
      COUNT(t.id) as total_tasks,
      SUM(CASE WHEN t.status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_tasks
    FROM projects p
    LEFT JOIN project_members pm ON p.id = pm.project_id
    LEFT JOIN tasks t ON p.id = t.project_id
    WHERE p.status = 'active'
    GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.status
  `
}

// Auto-generated API endpoint
GET /api/v1/views/v_active_projects

# Roles & Permissions

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with custom roles and granular permissions.

## Permission Model
Copy
```
// Permission format: resource.action

// Examples:
tasks.read          // View tasks
tasks.create        // Create new tasks
tasks.update        // Edit tasks
tasks.delete        // Delete tasks
tasks.assign        // Assign tasks to others

users.read          // View users
users.manage        // Manage user accounts

reports.export      // Export reports
settings.configure  // Modify settings
```

## Creating Custom Roles

#### Role Configuration

# Mobile Components

Complete library of 21 native React Native components for building iOS and Android apps. Each component is optimized for touch interactions and mobile performance.

### Mobile-First Components

When you create a mobile app (app.type === 'mobile'), the component drawer automatically shows these React Native components instead of web components. No conversion needed!

## Component Categories

### Mobile Layout (4 components)

Container and layout components for structuring your mobile app

#### View

- • onLayout - Called when layout changes

#### ScrollView

Scrollable container for content that exceeds screen size.
Copy
```
<ScrollView 
  horizontal={false}
  showsVerticalScrollIndicator={true}

# Mobile Preview

Test your mobile app on real iOS and Android devices instantly. Scan a QR code with Expo Go and see your app running on your phone in seconds.

### Canvas Preview

See mobile components rendered in the builder canvas using React Native Web

- • Click "App" button in canvas
- • Instant visual feedback
- • No device needed

### Device Preview

Test on real iOS/Android devices with QR code and Expo Go

- • Scan QR code
- • Test on real device
- • Native performance

## How Mobile Preview Works

### Fargate-Based Preview System

AlgorithmShift uses AWS Fargate to deploy your app as a temporary Expo development server:

1. Your app is packaged as a complete React Native/Expo project
1. Project is uploaded to S3 as a ZIP file
1. Fargate container downloads and runs Expo dev server
1. QR code is generated pointing to the Expo server
1. Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your device
1. App loads and runs natively on your phone

## Quick Start Guide
1
### Install Expo Go

Download Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device:

iOS (iPhone/iPad)

Download from App Store
[App Store Link →](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
Android

Download from Google Play
[Google Play Link →](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)2
### Build Your Mobile App

Create or open a mobile app in AlgorithmShift:
Copy
```
// When creating app, set type to 'mobile'
{
  "name": "My Mobile App",
  "type": "mobile",  // ← Important!
  "workspace_id": "your-workspace-id"
}
```
Component drawer shows mobile components automaticallyDrag TouchableOpacity, FlatList, TextInput, etc.Configure mobile-specific properties3
### Start Mobile Preview

Click the "Mobile Preview" button in your app builder:

What happens:

1. App is packaged as React Native/Expo project
1. ZIP file uploaded to S3
1. Fargate container starts Expo dev server (~30-60 seconds)
1. QR code appears when ready

First preview takes 30-60 seconds while the container starts. Subsequent previews are faster if container stays warm.
4
### Scan QR Code

Use Expo Go to scan the QR code:

iOS

1. Open Expo Go app
1. Tap "Scan QR Code"
1. Point camera at QR code
1. App loads automatically

Android

1. Open Expo Go app
1. Tap "Scan QR Code"
1. Point camera at QR code
1. Tap to open when detected

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Appearing

Possible causes:

- Fargate container starting (wait 30-60 seconds)
- Build error (check logs in preview modal)
- AWS resources unavailable

Solution: Wait for container to fully start. Check console logs for errors.

### App Won't Load on Device

Possible causes:

- Device not on same network (Expo requires connectivity)
- Firewall blocking Expo dev server
- Expo Go app outdated

Solution: Ensure device and server can communicate. Update Expo Go app. Try scanning again.

### "Unable to Connect to Metro" Error

This means Expo Go can't reach the development server.

Solution:

- Wait longer for server to fully start
- Check if Fargate container is running
- Rescan QR code
- Restart Expo Go app

### Components Not Rendering Correctly

Check:

- Using mobile components (not web components)
- StyleSheet properties valid for React Native
- No web-specific CSS (like display: grid)

Solution: Use mobile components from the component drawer. Check properties panel for mobile-specific props.

## Preview Limitations

### Current Limitations

- • Preview Duration:Preview expires after 30 minutes of inactivity
- • Data Sources:May show placeholder data instead of live API data
- • Authentication:May not reflect actual auth flows
- • Native Modules:Some native features (camera, maps) may not work in preview
- • Performance:Preview runs in dev mode (slower than production build)

For production testing: Download the ZIP and build locally or deploy to app stores.

## Download for Local Development

### Download Complete Project

For full control and local development, download your app as a complete React Native/Expo project:

1. Click "Download ZIP" in Mobile Preview modal
1. Extract ZIP file
1. Run npm install
1. Run npm start to start Expo
1. Scan QR code or run on simulator
Copy
```
# Extract and run locally
unzip my-mobile-app.zip
cd my-mobile-app
npm install
npm start

# Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
npm run ios

# Run on Android emulator
npm run android
```

# Advanced Filtering - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShift

**URL:** https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/api/filtering

**Description:** Powerful query filtering with shorthand operators. Date ranges, pattern matching, multiple conditions, and more.

---

Advanced Filtering - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationAPI Reference
# Advanced Filtering

Filter your data with powerful shorthand operators. Build complex queries with date ranges, pattern matching, multiple conditions, and logical operators—all via simple URL parameters.

## Shorthand Operators

Use bracket notation in query parameters to apply different comparison operators:
ShorthandSQL OperatorDescriptionExample`gte``>=`Greater than or equal`amount[gte]=1000``lte``<=`Less than or equal`amount[lte]=5000``gt``>`Greater than`price[gt]=100``lt``<`Less than`price[lt]=500``eq``=`Equals (explicit)`status[eq]=active``ne``!=`Not equals`status[ne]=cancelled``like``LIKE`Pattern match (case-sensitive)`email[like]=@example.com``ilike``ILIKE`Pattern match (case-insensitive)`name[ilike]=john``in``IN`Value in list`category[in]=A,B,C``isnull``IS NULL`Is null`deleted_at[isnull]=true``isnotnull``IS NOT NULL`Is not null`email[isnotnull]=true`
## Common Use Cases

### Date Range Filtering

Find records within a date range
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/lead?
  assigned_on[gte]=2025-01-18&
  assigned_on[lte]=2025-11-18
```

SQL Output:
Copy
```
WHERE (assigned_on >= '2025-01-18' AND assigned_on <= '2025-11-18')
```

Auto-conversion: Date/timestamp fields automatically convert string values to Date objects.

### Numeric Range

Filter by numeric ranges
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/opportunity?
  amount[gt]=1000&
  amount[lt]=5000
```

SQL Output:
Copy
```
WHERE (amount > 1000 AND amount < 5000)
```

### Multiple Exclusions

Exclude multiple values
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/lead?
  status[ne]=cancelled&
  status[ne]=deleted
```

SQL Output:
Copy
```
WHERE (status != 'cancelled' AND status != 'deleted')
```

### Pattern Matching

Search with wildcards
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/contact?
  name[ilike]=john&
  email[like]=@example.com
```

SQL Output:
Copy
```
WHERE name ILIKE '%john%' AND email LIKE '%@example.com%'
```

Difference:

- like - Case-sensitive (PostgreSQL LIKE)
- ilike - Case-insensitive (PostgreSQL ILIKE)

### IN Operator (Multiple Values)

Match any value in a list
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/lead?
  category[in]=electronics,furniture,clothing
```

SQL Output:
Copy
```
WHERE category IN ('electronics', 'furniture', 'clothing')
```

Tip: Separate values with commas. No spaces needed.

### NULL Checks

Filter by null/non-null values
Copy
```
# Find records with null email
GET /api/v1/entities/contact?email[isnull]=true

# Find records with non-null phone
GET /api/v1/entities/contact?phone[isnotnull]=true
```

SQL Output:
Copy
```
WHERE email IS NULL

WHERE phone IS NOT NULL
```

## Combining Multiple Conditions

### Multiple Conditions on Same Field (AND)

Use multiple operators on the same field—they're combined with AND:
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/opportunity?
  amount[gte]=1000&
  amount[lte]=10000&
  amount[ne]=5000
```

SQL Output:
Copy
```
WHERE (
  amount >= 1000 
  AND amount <= 10000 
  AND amount != 5000
)
```

### Multiple Fields (AND by default)

Different fields are combined with AND:
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/lead?
  status=active&
  assigned_on[gte]=2025-01-01&
  amount[gt]=1000
```

SQL Output:
Copy
```
WHERE 
  status = 'active' 
  AND assigned_on >= '2025-01-01' 
  AND amount > 1000
```

### OR Logic (Use logic parameter)

Change global logic to OR with the logic parameter:
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/lead?
  logic=or&
  status=active&
  status=pending&
  priority=high
```

SQL Output:
Copy
```
WHERE (
  status = 'active' 
  OR status = 'pending' 
  OR priority = 'high'
)
```

## Real-World Examples

### Find High-Value Active Opportunities This Quarter
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/opportunity?
  status=active&
  amount[gte]=10000&
  close_date[gte]=2025-01-01&
  close_date[lte]=2025-03-31&
  stage[ne]=lost
```

### Find Unassigned Leads from Specific Sources
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/lead?
  assigned_to[isnull]=true&
  source[in]=website,referral,email_campaign&
  created_at[gte]=2025-11-01
```

### Find Contacts with Gmail Addresses Named John
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/contact?
  name[ilike]=john&
  email[like]=@gmail.com&
  email[isnotnull]=true
```

### Find Cancelled or Refunded Orders Over $500
Copy
```
GET /api/v1/entities/order?
  logic=or&
  status[in]=cancelled,refunded&
  total[gt]=500&
  created_at[gte]=2025-01-01
```

## Simple Equality (No Brackets)

Fields without brackets default to equality operator:
Copy
```
# These are equivalent:
GET /api/v1/entities/lead?status=active
GET /api/v1/entities/lead?status[eq]=active

# Both produce:
WHERE status = 'active'
```

## Performance Tips

### Do

- • Use indexed columns in filters (status, created_at, etc.)
- • Combine with pagination (limit, offset)
- • Use specific date ranges instead of open-ended
- • Use in operator for multiple values (more efficient than multiple OR)

### Avoid

- • Leading wildcards in LIKE (%text) - can't use indexes
- • Filtering on non-indexed columns with large datasets
- • Too many OR conditions (consider restructuring query)
- • Open-ended date queries without upper bound

Data Authorization & Security - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Data Authorization & Row-Level Security

AlgorithmShift's enterprise-grade, Salesforce-style multi-layered security system. Database-enforced access control that cannot be bypassed, with 5 layers of protection for your data.

### Why This System is Special

Unlike traditional application-level security, AlgorithmShift enforces access control at the database level. This means:

- Cannot be bypassed: Security is enforced by PostgreSQL, not application code
- Automatic: No manual security checks needed in your code
- Performant: Optimized at the database query level
- Flexible: 5 complementary layers for any security requirement

## The 5-Layer Security Model

AlgorithmShift's security system uses 5 complementary layers that work together to control data access:
0
### Workspace Admin Bypass

First line of evaluation

Users with workspace_admin role automatically see all data, bypassing all other layers.
Copy
```
-- If user has workspace_admin role
SELECT * FROM customers  -- Returns ALL records (no filtering)
```
1
### Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)

Table-level default access

Each table has a default access level: Public Read/Write, Public Read Only, Private, or Controlled by Parent.

Public Read/Write

Everyone sees & edits all

Public Read Only

See all, edit own

Private

See & edit only own

Controlled by Parent

Inherit parent access
2
### Ownership

Record owner access

Users automatically have access to records they own (via owner_id field).
Copy
```
-- User can access their own records
owner_id = current_user_id()
```
3
### Group Membership

Group-based access

Users have access to records belonging to their groups (via primary_group_id and secondary_group_id).
Copy
```
-- User can access records from their groups
primary_group_id IN (SELECT group_id FROM user_groups WHERE user_id = current_user_id())
OR
secondary_group_id IN (SELECT group_id FROM user_groups WHERE user_id = current_user_id())
```
4
### Explicit Shares

Manual record sharing

Records can be explicitly shared with users, groups, or other records via sys_record_group_bindings.
Copy
```
-- User can access explicitly shared records
EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM sys_record_group_bindings rgb
  WHERE rgb.entity_name = 'customers'
  AND rgb.entity_id = customers.id
  AND rgb.principal_id IN (current_user_groups())
)
```
5
### RLS Policies

Custom security rules

Custom Row-Level Security policies with conditions via sys_record_bindings.
Copy
```
-- Custom RLS policy example
region = current_user_region()
AND 
department_id = current_user_department()
AND
status IN ('active', 'pending')
```

## How Layers Combine
Copy
```
Layer 0 (Admin Bypass):
  IF user.role = 'workspace_admin' THEN
    → Return ALL records (skip other layers)
  END IF

Layer 1 (Table OWD):
  IF table.default_access = 'public_read_write' THEN
    → Return ALL records (skip layers 2-4)
  ELSE IF table.default_access = 'public_read_only' THEN
    → Return ALL records (read), apply layers 2-4 for write
  END IF

Layers 2-4 (Ownership, Groups, Shares) - Combined with OR:
  WHERE (
    owner_id = current_user                    -- Layer 2: Ownership
    OR
    primary_group_id IN (user_groups)          -- Layer 3: Groups
    OR
    secondary_group_id IN (user_groups)
    OR
    EXISTS (explicit shares)                   -- Layer 4: Shares
  )

Layer 5 (RLS Policies) - Combined with AND:
  AND (
    custom_rls_conditions                      -- Layer 5: Policies
  )
```

## Complete Example

Here's how a simple query gets transformed by the security system:

#### Your Code
Copy
```
// Simple query
SELECT * FROM customers
```

#### What Actually Executes
Copy
```
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE (
  -- Layer 2: Ownership
  owner_id = 'user-123'
  OR
  -- Layer 3: Groups  
  primary_group_id IN ('grp-1', 'grp-2')
  OR
  secondary_group_id IN ('grp-1', 'grp-2')
  OR
  -- Layer 4: Shares
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sys_record_group_bindings
    WHERE entity_name = 'customers'
    AND entity_id = customers.id
    AND principal_id IN ('user-123', 'grp-1', 'grp-2')
  )
)
AND (
  -- Layer 5: RLS Policies
  region = 'US'
  AND status = 'active'
)
```

## Key Features

### Database-Enforced

Security applied by PostgreSQL, impossible to bypass through API or code

### Automatic

Universal RLS automatically applies all security layers to every query

### Multi-Layered

5 complementary layers: admin bypass, OWD, ownership, groups, shares, policies

### Principal-Based

Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)

Set the baseline access level for each table. OWD is the first layer of security evaluation after workspace admin bypass, defining what users can see by default.

## The Four OWD Modes

Each table in your database has one of four default access levels:

### Public Read/Write

Most open access

All users can see AND edit all records in the table.
**Read:** Everyone sees all records**Write:** Everyone can edit all records**Delete:** Everyone can delete all recordsCopy
```
SELECT * FROM countries
-- Returns ALL records (no filtering)
```

### Public Read Only

View all, edit only yours

All users can see all records, but can only edit/delete their own (or those shared with them).
**Read:** Everyone sees all records**Write:** Only your records (layers 2-4 apply)**Delete:** Only your records (layers 2-4 apply)Copy
```
-- READ: All records visible
SELECT * FROM products
-- Returns ALL records

-- WRITE: Only filtered records
UPDATE products SET price = 100
WHERE (owner_id = current_user OR ...)
```

### Private

Most restrictive

Users can only see and edit records they own or that are shared with them.
**Read:** Only your records (layers 2-4 apply)**Write:** Only your records (layers 2-4 apply)**Delete:** Only your records (layers 2-4 apply)Copy
```
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE (
  owner_id = current_user
  OR primary_group_id IN (user_groups)
  OR EXISTS (explicit shares)
)
-- Only returns YOUR records
```

### Controlled by Parent

Inherit from parent table

Access is determined by the parent record. If you can see the parent, you can see the child.
**Parent Access:** Requires parent_table_name field**Automatic:** Child records inherit parent access**Common Use:** Order Line Items → OrdersCopy
```
-- If parent_table_name = 'orders'
SELECT * FROM order_line_items
WHERE order_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM orders
  WHERE (... parent access rules ...)
)
-- Inherits Orders access
```

## OWD Configuration

Set OWD for each table in the table settings:

### Table Settings Location
Copy
```
Admin Interface Path:
/{workspaceId}/access-control/data-management/tables

1. Select your table from the list
2. Click "Settings" or "Edit"
3. Find "Default Access" field
4. Choose one of four modes:
   - public_read_write
   - public_read_only
   - private
   - controlled_by_parent

5. Save changes
```

## Database Schema

OWD settings are stored in the sys_table_settings table:
Copy
```
CREATE TABLE sys_table_settings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id UUID NOT NULL,
  table_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  
  -- OWD Configuration
  default_access VARCHAR DEFAULT 'private',
    -- 'public_read_write'
    -- 'public_read_only'
    -- 'private'
    -- 'controlled_by_parent'
  
  -- Parent Table (for controlled_by_parent mode)
  parent_table_name VARCHAR,
  parent_id_column VARCHAR DEFAULT 'parent_id',
  
  -- RLS Configuration
  rls_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  
  -- Audit Configuration
  track_created_by BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  track_updated_by BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  
  UNIQUE(workspace_id, table_name)
);
```

## Choosing the Right OWD Mode

Public Read/Write

Use For:

- • Reference data (countries, states, categories)
- • Shared configuration tables
- • Lookup tables
- • Public announcements

⚠️ Be careful: Everyone can modify data!

Public Read Only

Use For:

- • Product catalogs (view all, edit yours)
- • Knowledge bases (read all, create yours)
- • Company directory (see everyone, edit yourself)
- • Shared resources with ownership

✓ Good balance: Visibility + ownership

Private

Use For:

- • Customer data (accounts, contacts)
- • Financial records (invoices, payments)
- • Sensitive information (medical records)
- • Personal user data

✓ Most secure: Explicit sharing required

Controlled by Parent

Use For:

- • Child records (order → line items)
- • Nested data (account → contacts → notes)
- • Related records that follow parent
- • Hierarchical data structures

→ Simplifies complex hierarchies

## How OWD Interacts with Other Layers

OWD is evaluated early in the security chain, but other layers can grant additional access:
Copy
```
Example: Table with OWD = "private"

1. OWD says: "You can only see your own records"
2. But other layers can EXPAND access:
   - Ownership (Layer 2): + Records you own
   - Groups (Layer 3): + Records from your groups
   - Shares (Layer 4): + Records explicitly shared with you
   - RLS Policies (Layer 5): + Records matching custom rules

Result: Private OWD + Group sharing = You see your records AND your team's records

Important: OWD sets the BASELINE. Other layers can only ADD more access, 
never remove it (except Layer 5 RLS policies, which use AND logic).
```

# Ownership & Groups - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShift

**URL:** https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/data-authorization/ownership

**Description:** Record ownership, group membership, and hierarchical access control through owner_id, primary_group_id, and secondary_group_id fields.

---

Ownership & Groups - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Ownership & Groups

Layers 2 and 3 of the security model: ownership-based and group-based access control. These automatic mechanisms grant access based on record fields.

## The Three Key Fields

Every table can have three special fields that control access:

### owner_id

UUID reference to the user or group who owns this record

Layer 2: Ownership

### primary_group_id

UUID reference to the primary group that has access

Layer 3: Groups

### secondary_group_id

UUID reference to a secondary group for additional access

Layer 3: Groups

## Layer 2: Ownership (owner_id)

Records with an owner_id field automatically grant full access to the owner.

### How Ownership Works

Automatic Access

If owner_id matches your user ID, you automatically have access

Full Control

Owners can read, update, and delete their records

Group Ownership

owner_id can reference a group; all group members get access
Copy
```
-- Ownership filter (automatically applied)
WHERE owner_id = current_user_id()

-- If owner_id is a group
WHERE owner_id IN (SELECT group_id FROM user_groups WHERE user_id = current_user_id())
```

### Example: Customer Records
Copy
```
-- Create a customer record
INSERT INTO customers (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES (
  '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
  'Acme Corp',
  'user-alice-uuid'  -- Alice owns this customer
);

-- Alice's query (automatically filtered)
SELECT * FROM customers;
-- Returns: Acme Corp (and any other records Alice owns)

-- Bob's query (different user)
SELECT * FROM customers;
-- Returns: Nothing (unless Bob has access through other layers)
```

## Layer 3: Group Membership

Records with primary_group_id or secondary_group_id grant access to all group members.

### Group Access Pattern
Copy
```
-- Group membership filter (automatically applied)
WHERE 
  primary_group_id IN (
    SELECT group_id FROM user_groups WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
  )
  OR
  secondary_group_id IN (
    SELECT group_id FROM user_groups WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
  )
```

### Example: Sales Team Records
Copy
```
-- Setup: Alice and Bob are in "Sales Team" group
INSERT INTO sys_groups (id, name) VALUES ('grp-sales', 'Sales Team');
INSERT INTO sys_user_groups (user_id, group_id) VALUES 
  ('user-alice', 'grp-sales'),
  ('user-bob', 'grp-sales');

-- Create an opportunity for the Sales Team
INSERT INTO opportunities (id, name, primary_group_id)
VALUES (
  'opp-123',
  'Big Deal',
  'grp-sales'  -- Assigned to Sales Team
);

-- Alice's query
SELECT * FROM opportunities;
-- Returns: Big Deal (Alice is in Sales Team)

-- Bob's query
SELECT * FROM opportunities;
-- Returns: Big Deal (Bob is also in Sales Team)

-- Charlie's query (not in Sales Team)
SELECT * FROM opportunities;
-- Returns: Nothing (unless Charlie has access through other layers)
```

## Hierarchical Groups

Groups can have parent-child relationships. Members of child groups automatically inherit access from parent groups.
Copy
```
-- Group hierarchy
Company (grp-company)
└── Sales Department (grp-sales) [parent: grp-company]
    ├── East Region (grp-east) [parent: grp-sales]
    │   └── Team A (grp-team-a) [parent: grp-east]
    └── West Region (grp-west) [parent: grp-sales]

-- User memberships
Alice → Member of "Team A"
Bob → Member of "East Region"
Charlie → Member of "Sales Department"

-- Record assigned to "Sales Department"
INSERT INTO opportunities (id, name, primary_group_id)
VALUES ('opp-456', 'Enterprise Deal', 'grp-sales');

-- Who can see this opportunity?
✓ Alice (via Team A → East Region → Sales Department)
✓ Bob (via East Region → Sales Department)
✓ Charlie (direct member of Sales Department)
✗ Diana (not in hierarchy)

-- Hierarchy function (automatically applied)
current_user_groups_with_hierarchy()
-- Returns: ['grp-team-a', 'grp-east', 'grp-sales', 'grp-company'] for Alice
```

## Primary vs Secondary Group

Why two group fields? Different use cases and flexibility.

#### primary_group_id

Main organizational group

- • Department or team
- • Primary ownership group
- • Default assignment
- • Used for reporting

Example: "Sales Department"

#### secondary_group_id

Secondary access group

- • Cross-functional team
- • Project group
- • Temporary assignment
- • Additional collaborators

Example: "Project Phoenix"

## Combined Example

Ownership and groups work together with OR logic:
Copy
```
-- Complete filter for Layers 2 & 3
SELECT * FROM opportunities
WHERE (
  -- Layer 2: Ownership
  owner_id = current_user_id()
  OR
  owner_id IN (current_user_groups())
  
  OR
  
  -- Layer 3: Primary Group
  primary_group_id IN (current_user_groups_with_hierarchy())
  
  OR
  
  -- Layer 3: Secondary Group
  secondary_group_id IN (current_user_groups_with_hierarchy())
)
-- Plus other layers (OWD, shares, RLS policies)

-- Real scenario:
Alice is user 'user-alice'
Alice is in groups: ['grp-team-a', 'grp-east', 'grp-sales']

Opportunity #1:
  owner_id: 'user-alice'
  ✓ Alice can see (Layer 2: owner)

Opportunity #2:
  owner_id: 'user-bob'
  primary_group_id: 'grp-sales'
  ✓ Alice can see (Layer 3: Alice in grp-sales)

Opportunity #3:
  owner_id: 'user-bob'
  primary_group_id: 'grp-west'
  secondary_group_id: 'grp-team-a'
  ✓ Alice can see (Layer 3: Alice in grp-team-a via secondary)

Opportunity #4:
  owner_id: 'user-charlie'
  primary_group_id: 'grp-west'
  ✗ Alice CANNOT see (no matching layer)
```

## Best Practices

### Ownership & Group Best Practices

✓ Use owner_id for individual ownership

Assign records to individual users who are responsible for them

✓ Use primary_group_id for team access

Share records with entire teams or departments automatically

✓ Use secondary_group_id for cross-functional work

Grant access to project teams or temporary collaborators

✓ Leverage group hierarchies

Organize groups in a tree structure for automatic access inheritance

✓ Combine with OWD for baseline security

Set table OWD to "private", then use groups to grant team access

Record Sharing - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Record Sharing

Layer 4: Explicit manual sharing of records with users, groups, or other records. Grant access beyond ownership and group membership.

## What is Record Sharing?

Record sharing allows you to grant access to specific records to specific principals (users, groups, or other records), regardless of ownership or group membership.

### sys_record_group_bindings Table

All record shares are stored in the sys_record_group_bindings table. This table links records to principals with specific access levels.

## Access Levels

When sharing a record, you specify one of three access levels:

### read

View only

User can view the record but cannot edit or delete it

### read_write

View and edit

User can view and edit the record but cannot delete or share it

### manage

Full control

User can view, edit, delete, and share the record (like ownership)

## sys_record_group_bindings Schema
Copy
```
CREATE TABLE sys_record_group_bindings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id UUID NOT NULL,
  
  -- Which record is being shared
  entity_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,  -- Table name (e.g., "customers")
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,       -- Record ID
  
  -- Who gets access (principal)
  principal_id UUID NOT NULL,    -- User ID, Group ID, or Record ID
  principal_type VARCHAR,         -- 'user', 'group', or 'record'
  
  -- What level of access
  access_level VARCHAR NOT NULL,  -- 'read', 'read_write', or 'manage'
  
  -- Metadata
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID,
  
  -- Prevent duplicates
  UNIQUE(workspace_id, entity_name, entity_id, principal_id)
);
```

## Share with a User

Grant access to a specific user:
Copy
```
-- Share customer record with Bob (read-only)
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  entity_name,
  entity_id,
  principal_id,
  principal_type,
  access_level
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'customers',
  'customer-456',    -- The customer record being shared
  'user-bob',        -- Bob's user ID
  'user',
  'read'             -- Bob can only view
);

-- Now Bob can see this customer in his queries
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = 'customer-456';
-- Returns: customer-456 (Bob has explicit share)
```

## Share with a Group

Grant access to an entire group:
Copy
```
-- Share opportunity with entire Support Team (read/write)
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  entity_name,
  entity_id,
  principal_id,
  principal_type,
  access_level
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'opportunities',
  'opp-789',
  'grp-support',     -- Support Team group ID
  'group',
  'read_write'       -- Support Team can view and edit
);

-- All members of Support Team can now see and edit this opportunity
-- Alice (member of Support Team)
SELECT * FROM opportunities WHERE id = 'opp-789';
-- Returns: opp-789

-- Bob (member of Support Team)
UPDATE opportunities SET status = 'in_progress' WHERE id = 'opp-789';
-- Success! Bob can edit
```

## Share with a Record (Record as Principal)

Share records based on relationships (e.g., all contacts of an account):
Copy
```
-- Share contact with the parent Account record
-- Anyone who can see the Account can see this Contact
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  entity_name,
  entity_id,
  principal_id,
  principal_type,
  access_level
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'contacts',
  'contact-111',
  'account-222',     -- The parent Account record
  'record',
  'read'
);

-- This creates a relationship:
-- "Anyone who has access to Account 222 also has read access to Contact 111"

-- Example:
-- Alice owns Account 222 → Alice can see Contact 111
-- Bob has explicit share to Account 222 → Bob can see Contact 111
-- Charlie has NO access to Account 222 → Charlie CANNOT see Contact 111
```

## How Shares Are Applied in Queries
Copy
```
-- Layer 4: Record sharing filter (automatically applied)
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE (
  -- Layers 0-3 (admin bypass, OWD, ownership, groups)
  ... other layers ...
  
  OR
  
  -- Layer 4: Explicit shares
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sys_record_group_bindings rgb
    WHERE rgb.entity_name = 'customers'
    AND rgb.entity_id = customers.id
    AND (
      -- Share with current user
      (rgb.principal_type = 'user' AND rgb.principal_id = current_user_id())
      OR
      -- Share with current user's groups
      (rgb.principal_type = 'group' AND rgb.principal_id IN (current_user_groups()))
      OR
      -- Share with records the user has access to (record as principal)
      (rgb.principal_type = 'record' AND rgb.principal_id IN (current_user_records()))
    )
  )
)
```

## Managing Shares in the UI

Share records from the admin interface:

### Record Sharing Interface

Navigate to: /{workspaceId}/access-control/authorization/record-shares

Features:

- • Select any table and record
- • Search for users or groups
- • Choose access level (read, read_write, manage)
- • View all shares for a record
- • Bulk sharing operations
- • Remove shares

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Cross-Department Collaboration
Copy
```
-- Scenario: Sales owns an account, but Support needs access
-- 1. Sales creates account
INSERT INTO accounts (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES ('acc-123', 'Acme Corp', 'user-sales-alice');

-- 2. Share with Support team (read_write)
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings
VALUES (..., 'accounts', 'acc-123', 'grp-support', 'group', 'read_write');

-- Result:
-- ✓ Alice (owner) can see and edit
-- ✓ Sales team (via Alice's group) can see and edit
-- ✓ Support team (via explicit share) can see and edit
-- ✗ Marketing cannot see (no access)
```

### Example 2: Executive Visibility
Copy
```
-- Scenario: CEO needs to see all high-value opportunities
-- 1. Create CEO group
INSERT INTO sys_groups (id, name) VALUES ('grp-executives', 'Executives');

-- 2. Share all opportunities > $100k with Executives (read-only)
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
  id, workspace_id, entity_name, entity_id, principal_id, principal_type, access_level
)
SELECT 
  gen_random_uuid(),
  workspace_id,
  'opportunities',
  id,
  'grp-executives',
  'group',
  'read'
FROM opportunities
WHERE amount > 100000;

-- Result: CEO can view (but not edit) all high-value deals
```

### Example 3: Hierarchical Record Access
Copy
```
-- Scenario: Account → Contacts → Notes (all follow account access)
-- 1. Alice owns Account
INSERT INTO accounts (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES ('acc-456', 'Big Corp', 'user-alice');

-- 2. Create Contact, share with Account record
INSERT INTO contacts (id, name, account_id)
VALUES ('con-789', 'John Doe', 'acc-456');

INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings
VALUES (..., 'contacts', 'con-789', 'acc-456', 'record', 'read_write');

-- 3. Create Note, share with Contact record
INSERT INTO notes (id, content, contact_id)
VALUES ('note-111', 'Important note', 'con-789');

INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings
VALUES (..., 'notes', 'note-111', 'con-789', 'record', 'read');

-- Result:
-- Alice owns Account → Can see Account
-- Alice can see Account → Can see Contact (shared with Account)
-- Alice can see Contact → Can see Note (shared with Contact)
-- Transitive access through record-as-principal!
```

## Best Practices

Use shares for exceptions

Shares are for special cases. Use OWD and groups for general access patterns.

Share with groups, not individual users

Sharing with groups is more maintainable as team membership changes.

Use record-as-principal for relationships

Parent-child relationships are perfect for record-based sharing.

Choose appropriate access levels

Use "read" for visibility, "read_write" for collaboration, "manage" rarely.

Audit shares regularly

Review sys_record_group_bindings to ensure appropriate access.

**Description:** Create custom Row-Level Security policies with conditions. Layer 5 of the security model.

---

RLS Policies - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# RLS Policies (Row-Level Security)

Layer 5: Custom security rules with conditions. Create fine-grained access policies that go beyond ownership, groups, and shares.

## What are RLS Policies?

RLS Policies (stored in sys_record_bindings) are custom security rules that add additional WHERE conditions to queries. Unlike layers 2-4 which use OR logic to expand access, RLS policies use AND logic to restrict access.

### Key Difference from Other Layers

Layers 2-4 (ownership, groups, shares) use OR logic - they add more records you can see.

Layer 5 (RLS policies) uses AND logic - they remove records, even if you have access via other layers.

## sys_record_bindings Schema
Copy
```
CREATE TABLE sys_record_bindings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id UUID NOT NULL,
  
  -- Which table this policy applies to
  entity_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,  -- Table name (e.g., "opportunities")
  
  -- Who this policy applies to
  principal_id UUID,             -- User, Group, or null (all users)
  principal_type VARCHAR,         -- 'user', 'group', or null
  
  -- The policy condition (SQL WHERE clause)
  condition TEXT NOT NULL,        -- e.g., "region = current_user_region()"
  
  -- Policy metadata
  name VARCHAR,
  description TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID
);
```

## RLS Functions

Use built-in functions in your RLS conditions:
FunctionReturnsDescription`current_user_id()`UUIDCurrent user's ID`current_user_email()`VARCHARCurrent user's email`current_user_groups()`UUID[]Array of user's group IDs`current_user_region()`VARCHARUser's region (custom field)`current_user_department()`VARCHARUser's department (custom field)`current_workspace_id()`UUIDCurrent workspace ID`is_workspace_admin()`BOOLEANTrue if user is workspace admin
## Creating RLS Policies

### Example 1: Regional Access

Users can only see opportunities in their region:
Copy
```
-- Create RLS policy for regional access
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  entity_name,
  principal_id,     -- null = applies to all users
  principal_type,   -- null = applies to all users
  condition,
  name,
  is_active
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'opportunities',
  null,             -- Apply to ALL users
  null,
  'region = current_user_region()',  -- The condition
  'Regional Access Policy',
  true
);

-- Now all queries are filtered by region
-- User Alice (region = 'US')
SELECT * FROM opportunities;
-- Returns: Only opportunities where region = 'US'

-- User Bob (region = 'EU')
SELECT * FROM opportunities;
-- Returns: Only opportunities where region = 'EU'
```

### Example 2: Department Restrictions

Users can only see records from their department:
Copy
```
-- Department-based policy
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  entity_name,
  condition,
  name
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'projects',
  'department_id = current_user_department_id()',
  'Department Access Policy'
);

-- Result: Users only see projects from their department
```

### Example 3: Status-Based Visibility

Regular users can only see active records:
Copy
```
-- Status policy (only for non-admins)
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  entity_name,
  condition,
  name
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'customers',
  'status IN (''active'', ''pending'') OR is_workspace_admin()',
  'Active Records Only Policy'
);

-- Regular users: Only see active/pending customers
-- Admins: See all customers (bypass via is_workspace_admin())
```

### Example 4: Complex Multi-Condition Policy
Copy
```
-- Multi-condition policy
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  entity_name,
  condition,
  name
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'opportunities',
  $$(
    region = current_user_region()
    AND 
    (
      amount < 10000  -- Small deals visible to all
      OR 
      created_by = current_user_id()  -- Or deals you created
      OR
      primary_group_id IN (current_user_groups())  -- Or your team's deals
    )
    AND
    status != 'archived'  -- Never show archived
  )$$,
  'Complex Opportunity Policy'
);
```

## Group-Specific Policies

Apply policies to specific groups only:
Copy
```
-- Policy that only applies to Sales Team
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  entity_name,
  principal_id,
  principal_type,
  condition,
  name
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'accounts',
  'grp-sales',    -- Only applies to Sales Team
  'group',
  'account_type = ''prospect'' OR account_type = ''customer''',
  'Sales Team Account Type Policy'
);

-- Sales Team members: See only prospects and customers
-- Other users: See all account types (policy doesn't apply)
-- Admins: See all accounts (bypass)
```

## How RLS Policies Are Applied
Copy
```
-- Complete query transformation with all 5 layers
SELECT * FROM opportunities

-- Transformed to:
SELECT * FROM opportunities
WHERE (
  -- Layer 0: Admin bypass
  is_workspace_admin()
  
  OR
  
  (
    -- Layers 2-4: Ownership, Groups, Shares (OR logic)
    (
      owner_id = current_user_id()
      OR
      primary_group_id IN (current_user_groups())
      OR
      EXISTS (explicit shares)
    )
    
    AND
    
    -- Layer 5: RLS Policies (AND logic - restricts access)
    (
      region = current_user_region()  -- Policy 1
      AND
      status IN ('active', 'pending')  -- Policy 2
      AND
      ... (other active policies)
    )
  )
)
```

## Best Practices

### RLS Policy Best Practices

✓ Keep policies simple

Complex policies impact query performance

✓ Use indexed columns in conditions

Create indexes on region, department_id, status, etc.

✓ Test policies thoroughly

Verify they don't accidentally hide too much or too little data

✓ Document policy purpose

Use descriptive names and descriptions

✓ Combine with OWD for efficiency

Use OWD=Private + RLS policies instead of just policies

⚠️ Remember: AND logic restricts

RLS policies can hide records you own or have been shared

# Permission Sets - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShift

**URL:** https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/data-authorization/permission-sets

**Description:** Deterministic UUID-based permission system for fast, in-memory permission checks.

---

Permission Sets - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Permission Sets

AlgorithmShift's unique deterministic UUID-based permission system enables instant, in-memory permission checks without database lookups.

## What Makes Permission Sets Special?

### Deterministic UUID v5 System

Traditional permission systems require database lookups: "Does user X have permission Y?"

AlgorithmShift uses deterministic UUIDs (UUID v5) for permissions. The same permission name always generates the same UUID.

Result: Check permissions in-memory with simple UUID array lookups. No database calls needed.

## How It Works
Copy
```
// Permission name → Deterministic UUID (always the same)
"ps_tbl_customers_r" → "8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b"
"ps_tbl_customers_w" → "1b2c3d4e-5f6a-7b8c-9d0e-1f2a3b4c5d6e"

// User's permissions stored as UUID array
user.permissions = [
  "8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b",  // read customers
  "1b2c3d4e-5f6a-7b8c-9d0e-1f2a3b4c5d6e",  // write customers
  ...
]

// Permission check (in-memory, instant)
function hasPermission(permissionName) {
  const uuid = generateUUIDv5(permissionName);  // Deterministic
  return user.permissions.includes(uuid);       // Array lookup
}

// No database query needed! ⚡
```

## Permission Set Naming Convention

All permission sets follow a consistent naming pattern:

#### Table Permissions
Copy
```
ps_tbl_{table_name}_{operation}

Examples:
  ps_tbl_customers_r       → Read customers table
  ps_tbl_customers_w       → Write customers table
  ps_tbl_customers_d       → Delete from customers table
  ps_tbl_opportunities_r   → Read opportunities table
  ps_tbl_opportunities_w   → Write opportunities table
```

#### Entity/API Permissions
Copy
```
ps_entities_{operation}

Examples:
  ps_entities_read         → Read entity metadata
  ps_entities_write        → Write entity metadata
  ps_entities_create       → Create new entities
  ps_entities_edit         → Edit existing entities
  ps_entities_delete       → Delete entities
```

#### Feature Permissions
Copy
```
ps_{feature}_{operation}

Examples:
  ps_workflows_create      → Create workflows
  ps_workflows_execute     → Execute workflows
  ps_ai_agents_manage      → Manage AI agents
  ps_portals_admin         → Administer portals
  ps_reports_create        → Create reports
  ps_reports_export        → Export report data
```

## UUID v5 Generation

Permission UUIDs are generated using UUID v5 with a namespace:
Copy
```
import { v5 as uuidv5 } from 'uuid';

// Workspace-specific namespace
const PERMISSION_NAMESPACE = 'workspace-123-permissions';

// Generate deterministic permission UUID
function getPermissionUUID(permissionName) {
  return uuidv5(permissionName, PERMISSION_NAMESPACE);
}

// Example usage
const readCustomersUUID = getPermissionUUID('ps_tbl_customers_r');
// Always returns: "8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b"

// Multiple calls return the SAME UUID
console.log(getPermissionUUID('ps_tbl_customers_r'));
// "8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b"
console.log(getPermissionUUID('ps_tbl_customers_r'));
// "8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b"  ← Same!
```

## User Permission Storage
Copy
```
-- sys_user_permissions table
CREATE TABLE sys_user_permissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  
  -- The deterministic permission UUID
  permission_id UUID NOT NULL,
  
  -- Optional: Store the name for reference
  permission_name VARCHAR,
  
  -- Grant metadata
  granted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  granted_by UUID,
  
  UNIQUE(workspace_id, user_id, permission_id)
);

-- Grant permission to user
INSERT INTO sys_user_permissions (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  user_id,
  permission_id,
  permission_name
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'user-alice',
  '8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b',  -- UUID for ps_tbl_customers_r
  'ps_tbl_customers_r'
);
```

## Permission Checking (Lightning Fast)

### In-Memory Check (No Database)
Copy
```
// Load user's permissions once (on login)
const userPermissions = [
  '8a7c9f2e-3b4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d1e2f3a4b',  // ps_tbl_customers_r
  '1b2c3d4e-5f6a-7b8c-9d0e-1f2a3b4c5d6e',  // ps_tbl_customers_w
  '2c3d4e5f-6a7b-8c9d-0e1f-2a3b4c5d6e7f',  // ps_workflows_create
  // ... stored in session/JWT
];

// Check permission (instant, in-memory)
function hasPermission(permissionName) {
  const permissionUUID = getPermissionUUID(permissionName);
  return userPermissions.includes(permissionUUID);
}

// Usage
if (hasPermission('ps_tbl_customers_w')) {
  // Allow write to customers
} else {
  // Deny access
}

// Performance: O(1) hash lookup, ~1 microsecond 🚀
```

### Permission Check in SQL
Copy
```
-- Check if user has permission (PostgreSQL)
CREATE FUNCTION has_permission(permission_name VARCHAR)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
DECLARE
  permission_uuid UUID;
BEGIN
  -- Generate deterministic UUID
  permission_uuid := uuid_generate_v5(
    'workspace-123-permissions'::uuid,
    permission_name
  );
  
  -- Check if user has this permission
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sys_user_permissions
    WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
    AND permission_id = permission_uuid
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Usage
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE has_permission('ps_tbl_customers_r');
```

## Assigning Permission Sets to Roles
Copy
```
-- Create role with multiple permission sets
INSERT INTO sys_roles (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  name,
  permission_sets  -- Array of permission NAMES (not UUIDs)
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'Sales Manager',
  ARRAY[
    'ps_tbl_accounts_r',
    'ps_tbl_accounts_w',
    'ps_tbl_opportunities_r',
    'ps_tbl_opportunities_w',
    'ps_tbl_reports_r',
    'ps_workflows_create'
  ]
);

-- When user is assigned this role, convert names → UUIDs
-- and insert into sys_user_permissions
INSERT INTO sys_user_permissions (
  id, workspace_id, user_id, permission_id, permission_name
)

## Benefits of Deterministic Permission UUIDs

### Lightning Fast

No database lookups. Check thousands of permissions per second with simple array includes.

### Deterministic

Same permission name always generates the same UUID across all servers and environments.

### Cacheable

Store user permissions in JWT, session, or memory. No cache invalidation needed.

### Secure

UUIDs are not guessable. Even if an attacker has a UUID, they can't create permissions.

### Developer Friendly

Use readable permission names in code. UUIDs are generated automatically.

### Scalable

Works with millions of users and billions of permission checks per day.

Universal RLS - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Universal RLS (Row-Level Security)

Automatic security injection for every database query. Write simple SQL, get enterprise-grade security automatically applied.

### What is Universal RLS?

Universal RLS is AlgorithmShift's automatic security system that intercepts every database query and injects all 5 security layers transparently.

You write: SELECT * FROM customersSystem executes: SELECT * FROM customers WHERE (5 layers of security)

## How Universal RLS Works

### 1. Query Interception

Every query passes through middleware that extracts user context

### 2. Security Injection

All 5 security layers are added to the WHERE clause automatically

### 3. Database Execution

PostgreSQL executes the secured query with optimized plan

## Implementation Methods

AlgorithmShift uses multiple techniques to ensure universal security:

### Method 1: PostgreSQL RLS Policies
Copy
```
-- Enable RLS on table
ALTER TABLE customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create universal policy
CREATE POLICY universal_rls_policy ON customers
FOR ALL
TO PUBLIC
USING (
  -- Layer 0: Admin bypass
  is_workspace_admin()
  
  OR
  
  (
    -- Layer 1: OWD check
    (
      get_table_owd('customers') IN ('public_read_write', 'public_read_only')
      OR
      -- Layers 2-4: Ownership, Groups, Shares (OR logic)
      (
        owner_id = current_user_id()
        OR primary_group_id IN (current_user_groups())
        OR secondary_group_id IN (current_user_groups())
        OR EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM sys_record_group_bindings ...)
      )
    )
    -- Layer 5: RLS policies (AND logic)
    AND apply_rls_policies('customers', id)
  )
);
```

Benefit: Database-native enforcement, impossible to bypass

### Method 2: Query Rewriting Middleware
Copy
```
// Middleware intercepts all queries
async function universalRLSMiddleware(query, user) {
  // Parse SQL query
  const ast = parseSQL(query);
  
  // Extract table name
  const tableName = ast.from[0].table;
  
  // Build security WHERE clause
  const securityClause = buildSecurityClause(tableName, user);
  
  // Inject security into query
  ast.where = ast.where 
    ? `(${ast.where}) AND (${securityClause})`
    : securityClause;
  
  // Return modified query
  return generateSQL(ast);
}

// Usage (automatic)
const result = await db.query('SELECT * FROM customers');
// Actually executes: SELECT * FROM customers WHERE (security...)
```

Benefit: Application-level control, flexible and testable

### Method 3: Set Session Context
Copy
```
-- At connection start, set user context
SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = 'user-alice';
SET LOCAL app.current_user_groups = 'grp-1,grp-2,grp-3';
SET LOCAL app.current_user_role = 'workspace_user';

-- Helper functions use session variables
CREATE FUNCTION current_user_id() RETURNS UUID AS $$
  SELECT current_setting('app.current_user_id')::uuid;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL STABLE;

-- RLS policies reference these functions
CREATE POLICY ... USING (owner_id = current_user_id());
```

Benefit: Fast, no parameter passing needed

## Automatic Application

Universal RLS applies to all query types automatically:

#### SELECT Queries
Copy
```
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
→ Filters rows based on all 5 layers
```

#### UPDATE Queries
Copy
```
UPDATE customers SET status = 'active' WHERE id = '123';
→ Only updates if user has access to record 123
```

#### DELETE Queries
Copy
```
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = '123';
→ Only deletes if user has access to record 123
```

#### JOIN Queries
Copy
```
SELECT * FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;
→ Filters both customers AND orders based on their respective security
```

#### Aggregate Queries
Copy
```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
→ Only counts records user has access to
```

## Performance Optimization

### Session Caching

- • User's groups cached in session
- • Permission UUIDs cached in JWT
- • Table settings cached in application
- • RLS policies compiled once

### Database Indexes

- • Index on owner_id
- • Index on primary_group_id
- • Index on secondary_group_id
- • Composite indexes for common patterns

### Query Planning

- • PostgreSQL query planner optimizes security WHERE clauses
- • Pushes filters as early as possible
- • Uses optimal join strategies

### Bypass for Admins

- • Admin check is first (Layer 0)
- • If admin, skip all security filters
- • No performance penalty for admins

## Testing Universal RLS
Copy
```
-- Test as different users
-- 1. Connect as admin
SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = 'admin-user';
SET LOCAL app.current_user_role = 'workspace_admin';

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
-- Returns: 10,000 (all records)

-- 2. Connect as regular user
SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = 'user-alice';
SET LOCAL app.current_user_role = 'workspace_user';
SET LOCAL app.current_user_groups = 'grp-sales';

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
-- Returns: 45 (only Alice's accessible records)

-- 3. Verify security is applied
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers;
-- Shows: Filter on owner_id, primary_group_id, etc.
```

## Disabling RLS (For System Operations)

### When to Disable RLS

In rare cases (system migrations, admin operations), you may need to bypass RLS:
Copy
```
-- Temporarily disable RLS (requires superuser)
SET LOCAL row_security = OFF;

-- Perform admin operation
UPDATE customers SET migration_flag = true;

-- Re-enable (automatic at transaction end)
COMMIT;
```

⚠️ Only use for trusted system operations

# How Access Works

Complete step-by-step evaluation flow showing how AlgorithmShift's 5-layer security model determines which records a user can access.

## The Complete Access Evaluation Flow
0
### Layer 0: Admin Bypass Check

First evaluation - highest priority
Copy
```
IF user.role = 'workspace_admin' THEN
  -- Return ALL records (no filtering)
  RETURN query_without_security
ELSE
  -- Continue to layers 1-5
  GOTO Layer_1
END IF
```

Result: Admins see everything, skip all other layers
1
### Layer 1: Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)

Table-level baseline access
Copy
```
table_settings = GET table_settings WHERE table_name = 'customers'

IF table_settings.default_access = 'public_read_write' THEN
  -- Return ALL records (no filtering)
  RETURN query_without_layers_2_to_5
  
ELSE IF table_settings.default_access = 'public_read_only' THEN
  -- For READ: Return ALL records
  -- For WRITE/DELETE: Continue to layers 2-5
  IF operation = 'SELECT' THEN
    RETURN query_without_layers_2_to_5
  ELSE
    GOTO Layer_2
  END IF
  
ELSE
  -- Private or controlled_by_parent
  GOTO Layer_2
END IF
```

Result: Public access modes may skip layers 2-4
2-4
### Layers 2-4: Ownership + Groups + Shares (OR Logic)

Combine with OR - expand access
Copy
```
-- Build WHERE clause with OR conditions
WHERE (
  -- Layer 2: Ownership
  owner_id = current_user_id()
  OR
  owner_id IN (SELECT group_id FROM user_groups 
               WHERE user_id = current_user_id())
  
  OR
  
  -- Layer 3: Primary Group
  primary_group_id IN (
    SELECT group_id FROM user_groups_hierarchy 
    WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
  )
  
  OR
  
  -- Layer 3: Secondary Group
  secondary_group_id IN (
    SELECT group_id FROM user_groups_hierarchy 
    WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
  )
  
  OR
  
  -- Layer 4: Explicit Shares
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sys_record_group_bindings rgb
    WHERE rgb.entity_name = 'customers'
    AND rgb.entity_id = customers.id
    AND rgb.principal_id IN (current_user_principals())
    AND rgb.access_level IN ('read', 'read_write', 'manage')
  )
)

-- Continue to Layer 5
GOTO Layer_5
```

Result: User can see records from ANY of these conditions
5
### Layer 5: RLS Policies (AND Logic)

Custom rules - restrict access
Copy
```
-- Get active RLS policies for table
policies = SELECT condition FROM sys_record_bindings
           WHERE entity_name = 'customers'
           AND is_active = true
           AND (principal_id IS NULL 
                OR principal_id IN (current_user_principals()))

-- Apply each policy with AND logic
AND (policy_1_condition)  -- e.g., region = current_user_region()
AND (policy_2_condition)  -- e.g., status IN ('active', 'pending')
AND (policy_N_condition)

-- Return final filtered records
RETURN records
```

Result: Records must pass ALL RLS policy conditions

## Complete SQL Example

#### What You Write
Copy
```
SELECT * 
FROM customers 
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

#### What Actually Executes
Copy
```
SELECT * 
FROM customers 
WHERE name LIKE 'A%'

-- Layer 0: Admin bypass
AND (
  is_workspace_admin()
  OR
  (
    -- Layers 2-4: OR logic
    (
      owner_id = 'user-alice'
      OR
      primary_group_id IN ('grp-1', 'grp-2')
      OR
      secondary_group_id IN ('grp-1', 'grp-2')
      OR
      EXISTS (...)  -- shares
    )
    
    -- Layer 5: AND logic
    AND region = 'US'
    AND status = 'active'
  )
);
```

## Real-World Scenario
Copy
```
Scenario: Alice queries customer table

User: Alice (user-alice)
Role: workspace_user
Groups: ['grp-sales-team', 'grp-east-region']
Region: 'US'

Table: customers
  default_access: 'private'
  
RLS Policies:
  1. region = current_user_region()
  2. status IN ('active', 'pending')

Records in Database:
  Customer A: owner_id='user-alice', region='US', status='active'
  Customer B: owner_id='user-bob', region='US', status='active'  
  Customer C: owner_id='user-bob', primary_group_id='grp-sales-team', region='US', status='active'
  Customer D: owner_id='user-bob', primary_group_id='grp-west-team', region='US', status='active'
  Customer E: owner_id='user-alice', region='EU', status='active'
  Customer F: owner_id='user-alice', region='US', status='archived'

Evaluation:

Layer 0 (Admin Bypass):
  → Alice is NOT admin, continue to Layer 1

Layer 1 (OWD):
  → default_access = 'private', continue to Layers 2-4

Layers 2-4 (Ownership/Groups/Shares - OR):
  Customer A: ✓ owner_id matches Alice
  Customer B: ✗ No match
  Customer C: ✓ primary_group_id = 'grp-sales-team' (Alice is member)
  Customer D: ✗ primary_group_id = 'grp-west-team' (Alice not member)
  Customer E: ✓ owner_id matches Alice
  Customer F: ✓ owner_id matches Alice
  
  Passed Layer 2-4: A, C, E, F

Layer 5 (RLS Policies - AND):
  Policy 1: region = 'US'
    Customer A: ✓ region='US'
    Customer C: ✓ region='US'
    Customer E: ✗ region='EU' ← BLOCKED
    Customer F: ✓ region='US'
  
  Policy 2: status IN ('active', 'pending')
    Customer A: ✓ status='active'
    Customer C: ✓ status='active'
    Customer F: ✗ status='archived' ← BLOCKED
  
FINAL RESULT: Alice sees Customers A and C only
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations

- • Admin bypass at query start (no filtering needed)
- • OWD can skip layers 2-4 for public tables
- • Indexes on owner_id, primary_group_id, secondary_group_id
- • User's groups cached in session
- • RLS policies compiled once, reused

### Database Level

- • All filtering happens in PostgreSQL
- • Query planner optimizes combined conditions
- • No application-level loops
- • Single database roundtrip
- • Scales to millions of records

# Principals Concept - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShift

**URL:** https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/data-authorization/principals

**Description:** Users, groups, and records as security principals. The foundation of AlgorithmShift's flexible access control.

---

Principals Concept - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Principals Concept

In AlgorithmShift, a "principal" is any entity that can own data, have permissions, or be granted access. Users, groups, and even records can be principals.

### What is a Principal?

A principal is an entity that can participate in the security system. Think of it as "who or what" in "who has access to what". AlgorithmShift supports three types of principals.

## The Three Types of Principals

### User Principal

Individual accounts

A user is the most common principal type

- • Can own records
- • Can be assigned permissions
- • Can have records shared with them
- • Can belong to groups

### Group Principal

Collections of users

Groups can act as principals themselves

- • Can own records
- • Can have records shared with them
- • All members inherit access
- • Hierarchical relationships

### Record Principal

Records as groups

Records can act as implicit groups

- • Account → implicit group
- • Related records auto-shared
- • Hierarchical access
- • Parent-child relationships

## User as Principal
Copy
```
-- User owns a customer record
INSERT INTO customers (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES ('cust-123', 'Acme Corp', 'user-alice');

-- User Alice can access this customer via ownership (Layer 2)

-- Record is shared with user Bob
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
  entity_name, entity_id, principal_id, principal_type, access_level
) VALUES (
  'customers', 'cust-123', 'user-bob', 'user', 'read'
);

-- User Bob can now access via sharing (Layer 4)
```

## Group as Principal

Groups can own records and have records shared with them:
Copy
```
-- Group owns a record
INSERT INTO opportunities (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES ('opp-456', 'Big Deal', 'grp-sales-team');

-- ALL members of Sales Team can access via ownership
-- Alice (member of Sales Team) → Can access
-- Bob (member of Sales Team) → Can access
-- Charlie (NOT in Sales Team) → Cannot access

-- Record is shared with Engineering group
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
  entity_name, entity_id, principal_id, principal_type, access_level
) VALUES (
  'opportunities', 'opp-456', 'grp-engineering', 'group', 'read'
);

-- Now ALL members of Engineering can read via sharing (Layer 4)
```

## Record as Principal (Advanced)

Records can act as implicit groups, enabling hierarchical access patterns:

### Example: Account Hierarchy
Copy
```
-- Alice owns Account "Acme Corp"
INSERT INTO accounts (id, name, owner_id)
VALUES ('acc-123', 'Acme Corp', 'user-alice');

-- Contact is "shared with" the Account record (record-as-principal)
INSERT INTO contacts (id, name, account_id)
VALUES ('con-456', 'John Doe', 'acc-123');

INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
  entity_name, entity_id, 
  principal_id, principal_type, access_level
) VALUES (
  'contacts', 'con-456',
  'acc-123', 'record', 'read_write'  -- Account is the principal!
);

-- Result: Anyone who can access Account acc-123 can also access Contact con-456
-- Alice owns Account → Alice can access Contact
-- If Bob is granted access to Account → Bob can access Contact too
-- Transitive access through record-as-principal!
```

### Example: Multi-Level Hierarchy
Copy
```
-- Three-level hierarchy: Account → Contact → Note
-- 1. Alice owns Account
INSERT INTO accounts VALUES ('acc-1', 'Acme', 'user-alice');

-- 2. Contact shared with Account (record-as-principal)
INSERT INTO contacts VALUES ('con-1', 'John', 'acc-1');
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings VALUES
  ('contacts', 'con-1', 'acc-1', 'record', 'read_write');

-- 3. Note shared with Contact (record-as-principal)
INSERT INTO notes VALUES ('note-1', 'Important', 'con-1');
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings VALUES
  ('notes', 'note-1', 'con-1', 'record', 'read');

-- Access Chain:
-- Alice owns Account acc-1
-- → Alice can access Contact con-1 (shared with acc-1)
-- → Alice can access Note note-1 (shared with con-1)

-- If Bob is granted access to the Account:
-- Bob gets access to Account → Contact → Note
-- Entire hierarchy cascades!
```

## Principal Resolution

How the system determines which principals a user belongs to:
Copy
```
-- Function: current_user_principals()
-- Returns all principal IDs the current user belongs to

CREATE FUNCTION current_user_principals() 
RETURNS UUID[] AS $$
  SELECT ARRAY(
    -- 1. User themselves
    SELECT current_user_id()
    
    UNION
    
    -- 2. All groups user belongs to (with hierarchy)
    SELECT group_id 
    FROM user_groups_hierarchy 
    WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
    
    UNION
    
    -- 3. All records user has access to (via ownership or sharing)
    SELECT DISTINCT entity_id::uuid
    FROM accessible_records
    WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
  );
$$ LANGUAGE SQL STABLE;

-- Usage in sharing check
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM sys_record_group_bindings rgb
  WHERE rgb.entity_name = 'customers'
  AND rgb.entity_id = customers.id
  AND rgb.principal_id IN (current_user_principals())  -- Check all principals
);
```

## Benefits of Principal-Based Access

### Flexibility

- • Share with users, groups, or records
- • Create complex hierarchies
- • Model real-world organizations
- • Support multi-tenant scenarios

### Maintainability

- • Change group membership → access updates automatically
- • No need to reshare individual records
- • Hierarchies propagate changes
- • Single source of truth

### Scalability

- • Efficient database queries
- • Works with millions of records
- • Indexed principal lookups
- • Cached principal resolution

### Intuitive

- • Mirrors real-world relationships
- • "Give Sales Team access to Account"
- • Natural parent-child access
- • Matches user mental models

# Field-Level Security - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShift

**URL:** https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/data-authorization/field-permissions

**Description:** Column-level access control with read, edit, and mask permissions for sensitive data protection.

---

Field-Level Security - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Field-Level Security (FLS)

Control access to individual columns. Hide sensitive fields, mask confidential data, or make fields read-only for specific users and groups.

## What is Field-Level Security?

Field-Level Security (FLS) provides column-level access control. While RLS controls which rows users can see, FLS controls which columns they can access.

### Complementary to Row-Level Security

RLS: "Which customer records can Alice see?" → Filters rows

FLS: "Can Alice see the SSN field?" → Filters columns

## Access Levels

Field permissions support three access levels:

### none

Completely hidden

Field is completely removed from query results. User cannot see the field exists.
Copy
```
// Query result
{
  id: "123",
  name: "John",
  // ssn: HIDDEN
}
```

### read

View only / masked

User can see the field but cannot edit it. Can optionally be masked.
Copy
```
// With mask_value: true
{
  credit_card: "****-****-****-1234"
}

// With mask_value: false
{
  created_at: "2024-01-15"
}
```

### edit

Full access

User can read and write to the field (default for all fields).
Copy
```
// Full access
{
  email: "john@example.com"
}
// Can be updated
```

## sys_field_permissions Schema
Copy
```
CREATE TABLE sys_field_permissions (
  permission_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id UUID NOT NULL,
  
  -- Which field this applies to
  table_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  column_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  
  -- Who this applies to (principal)
  principal_id UUID NOT NULL,        -- User, Group, or Role
  principal_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,   -- 'user', 'group', or 'role'
  
  -- Access configuration
  access_level VARCHAR NOT NULL,     -- 'none', 'read', or 'edit'
  mask_value BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,  -- Mask the value (for 'read' only)
  
  -- Metadata
  created_by UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  UNIQUE(workspace_id, table_name, column_name, principal_id)
);
```

## Common Use Cases

### Hide PII from Regular Users
Copy
```
-- Hide SSN, DOB, and Tax ID from all workspace users
INSERT INTO sys_field_permissions 
  (permission_id, workspace_id, table_name, column_name, 
   principal_id, principal_type, access_level)
VALUES
  -- SSN field
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'workspace-123', 'customers', 'ssn',
   'role-workspace-user', 'role', 'none'),
  
  -- Date of birth
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'workspace-123', 'customers', 'date_of_birth',
   'role-workspace-user', 'role', 'none'),
  
  -- Tax ID
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'workspace-123', 'customers', 'tax_id',
   'role-workspace-user', 'role', 'none');

-- Result: Regular users see customer records but these fields are hidden
-- Admins still see everything (bypass FLS)
```

### Mask Financial Data
Copy
```
-- Allow users to see credit card exists, but mask the number
INSERT INTO sys_field_permissions 
  (permission_id, workspace_id, table_name, column_name,
   principal_id, principal_type, access_level, mask_value)
VALUES
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'workspace-123', 'payments', 'credit_card_number',
   'role-workspace-user', 'role', 'read', true),
  
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'workspace-123', 'accounts', 'bank_account',
   'role-workspace-user', 'role', 'read', true);

-- Result: 
-- Original: credit_card_number = "4532-1234-5678-9010"
-- User sees: credit_card_number = "****-****-****-9010"
```

### Read-Only Audit Fields
Copy
```
-- Make audit fields read-only for all users
INSERT INTO sys_field_permissions 
  (permission_id, workspace_id, table_name, column_name,
   principal_id, principal_type, access_level)
SELECT
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  table_name,
  column_name,
  'role-workspace-user',
  'role',
  'read'
FROM (
  VALUES 
    ('customers', 'created_at'),
    ('customers', 'created_by'),
    ('customers', 'updated_at'),
    ('customers', 'updated_by')
) AS fields(table_name, column_name);

-- Result: Users can see when/who created/updated, but cannot modify
```

### Department-Specific Fields
Copy
```
-- Only HR can see salary and performance fields
INSERT INTO sys_field_permissions 
  (permission_id, workspace_id, table_name, column_name,
   principal_id, principal_type, access_level)
VALUES
  -- Hide from non-HR
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'workspace-123', 'employees', 'salary',
   'grp-sales', 'group', 'none'),
  
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'workspace-123', 'employees', 'performance_rating',
   'grp-sales', 'group', 'none');

-- HR group members: See all employee fields
-- Sales group members: Cannot see salary or performance_rating
```

## How FLS is Applied
Copy
```
// Server-side query processing with FLS

// 1. User queries customers table
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = '123';

// 2. RLS filters rows (which customers)
-- Result: User can access customer 123

// 3. FLS filters columns (which fields)
-- Check sys_field_permissions for user/group/role

// 4. Apply field restrictions
{
  id: "123",
  name: "Acme Corp",
  email: "contact@acme.com",
  // ssn: REMOVED (access_level = 'none')
  created_at: "2024-01-15",  // Read-only
  created_by: "user-alice",  // Read-only
  credit_card: "****-****-****-1234"  // Masked
}

// 5. Return filtered record to user
```

## Field Permission Templates

Pre-configured templates for common FLS scenarios:
TemplateFieldsAccess LevelHide PIIssn, date_of_birth, tax_id, passportnoneMask Financialcredit_card, bank_account, salaryread (masked)Read-Only Auditcreated_at, created_by, updated_at, updated_byreadHide Admin Fieldsinternal_notes, admin_status, approval_statusnoneManager Onlyperformance_rating, disciplinary_actionsnone (for non-managers)
## Managing Field Permissions

### Field Permissions Interface

Navigate to: /{workspaceId}/access-control/authorization/field-permissions

Browse by Table

Select table and configure field permissions

Templates

Apply pre-configured permission templates

Bulk Operations

Apply same permission to multiple fields

Test Access

Preview what users will see

## Best Practices

### Field-Level Security Best Practices

✓ Use FLS for sensitive fields only

Too many field restrictions impact query performance

✓ Apply to roles/groups, not individual users

Easier to maintain as team membership changes

✓ Use templates for common patterns

PII, financial, and audit field templates ensure consistency

✓ Mask instead of hide when possible

Masking (read + mask_value) preserves UI layout vs hiding (none)

✓ Test with real user accounts

Verify field permissions work as expected before deploying

⚠️ Remember: Admins bypass FLS

workspace_admin role sees all fields regardless of FLS

# Real-World Examples

Complete implementation scenarios showing how to configure AlgorithmShift's security system for common use cases.
[### CRM System

Sales teams, territories, account hierarchies](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/data-authorization/examples#crm)[### Multi-Tenant SaaS

Complete tenant isolation](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/data-authorization/examples#saas)[### Healthcare

HIPAA compliance, PHI protection](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/data-authorization/examples#healthcare)[### Education Platform

Students, teachers, courses](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/data-authorization/examples#education)[### E-Commerce

Orders, customers, inventory](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/data-authorization/examples#ecommerce)[### Enterprise ERP

Departments, branches, complex hierarchies](https://www.algorithmshift.ai/docs/data-authorization/examples#enterprise)
## Example 1: CRM System

Sales CRM with territories, account hierarchies, and opportunity management.

### Step 1: Group Structure
Copy
```
-- Create hierarchical sales organization
INSERT INTO sys_groups (id, name, parent_group_id, group_type_id) VALUES
  ('grp-sales', 'Sales Department', null, 'dept'),
  ('grp-na', 'North America', 'grp-sales', 'region'),
  ('grp-east', 'East Region', 'grp-na', 'region'),
  ('grp-west', 'West Region', 'grp-na', 'region'),
  ('grp-eu', 'Europe', 'grp-sales', 'region');

-- Add users to groups
INSERT INTO sys_user_groups (user_id, group_id) VALUES
  ('user-alice', 'grp-east'),  -- Alice in East
  ('user-bob', 'grp-west'),    -- Bob in West
  ('user-charlie', 'grp-eu');  -- Charlie in EU
```

### Step 2: Table Settings
Copy
```
-- Accounts: Private (sales rep ownership)
UPDATE sys_table_settings SET
  default_access = 'private',
  rls_enabled = true,
  sharing_enabled = true
WHERE table_name = 'accounts';

-- Opportunities: Private
UPDATE sys_table_settings SET
  default_access = 'private'
WHERE table_name = 'opportunities';

-- Contacts: Controlled by parent (follow account)
UPDATE sys_table_settings SET
  default_access = 'controlled_by_parent',
  parent_table_name = 'accounts',
  parent_id_column = 'account_id'
WHERE table_name = 'contacts';

-- Products: Public read-only
UPDATE sys_table_settings SET
  default_access = 'public_read_only'
WHERE table_name = 'products';
```

### Step 3: RLS Policy (Territory-Based)
Copy
```
-- Users can only see accounts in their territory
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings (
  id, workspace_id, entity_name, condition, name
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'accounts',
  'territory = current_user_territory()',
  'Territory-Based Access'
);

-- Users can only see active opportunities
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings (
  id, workspace_id, entity_name, condition, name
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'opportunities',
  'status IN (''open'', ''negotiating'', ''won'')',
  'Active Opportunities Only'
);
```

### Step 4: Result

- • Alice (East) sees her accounts + East team accounts in East territory
- • Bob (West) sees his accounts + West team accounts in West territory
- • Managers see all accounts in their region (via group hierarchy)
- • VP of Sales sees all accounts (member of parent Sales group)
- • Contacts automatically follow account access
- • Everyone can view products, only product managers can edit

## Example 2: Multi-Tenant SaaS

Complete tenant isolation with per-tenant data access.

### Implementation
Copy
```
-- All tables have tenant_id column
ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID NOT NULL;

-- Universal RLS policy: tenant isolation
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings (
  id, workspace_id, entity_name, condition, name
) VALUES
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'ws-1', 'customers', 
   'tenant_id = current_user_tenant_id()', 'Tenant Isolation'),
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'ws-1', 'orders', 
   'tenant_id = current_user_tenant_id()', 'Tenant Isolation'),
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'ws-1', 'products', 
   'tenant_id = current_user_tenant_id()', 'Tenant Isolation');

-- Set session context on login
SET LOCAL app.current_tenant_id = 'tenant-acme';

-- All queries automatically filtered by tenant
SELECT * FROM customers;
-- Only returns Acme Corp's customers
```

## Example 3: Healthcare (HIPAA Compliance)

Protecting PHI with comprehensive security and audit logging.

### Table Settings + Field Permissions
Copy
```
-- Patients table: Private
UPDATE sys_table_settings SET
  default_access = 'private',
  rls_enabled = true
WHERE table_name = 'patients';

-- Hide PHI from non-medical staff
INSERT INTO sys_field_permissions 
  (table_name, column_name, principal_id, principal_type, access_level)
VALUES
  ('patients', 'ssn', 'role-admin-staff', 'role', 'none'),
  ('patients', 'medical_history', 'role-admin-staff', 'role', 'none'),
  ('patients', 'diagnoses', 'role-admin-staff', 'role', 'none');

-- RLS: Doctors see only their assigned patients
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(), 'ws-1', 'patients',
  'assigned_doctor_id = current_user_id()', 
  'Doctor-Patient Assignment'
);

-- Enable comprehensive audit logging
UPDATE sys_table_settings SET
  track_created_by = true,
  track_updated_by = true,
  audit_all_access = true  -- Log every read
WHERE table_name = 'patients';
```

## Example 4: Education Platform

Students, teachers, courses with grade privacy.

### Implementation
Copy
```
-- Students see their own courses
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(), 'ws-1', 'enrollments',
  'student_id = current_user_id()', 
  'Student Enrollment Access'
);

-- Teachers see courses they teach
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(), 'ws-1', 'courses',
  'teacher_id = current_user_id()', 
  'Teacher Course Access'
);

-- Students see course materials
UPDATE sys_table_settings SET
  default_access = 'private'
WHERE table_name = 'course_materials';

-- Share materials with enrolled students
INSERT INTO sys_record_group_bindings (
  entity_name, entity_id, principal_id, principal_type, access_level
)
SELECT 
  'course_materials',
  material_id,
  student_id,
  'user',
  'read'
FROM enrollments
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Hide grades from students until published
INSERT INTO sys_field_permissions VALUES
  ('assignments', 'grade', 'user-type-student', 'user_type', 'none')
WHERE NOT published;
```

## Example 5: E-Commerce Platform

Customers see their orders, vendors manage their products.

### Implementation
Copy
```
-- Customers: Private (see only their data)
UPDATE sys_table_settings SET default_access = 'private'
WHERE table_name IN ('orders', 'addresses', 'payment_methods');

-- Products: Public read-only (everyone browses)
UPDATE sys_table_settings SET default_access = 'public_read_only'
WHERE table_name = 'products';

-- Vendors see only their products
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(), 'ws-1', 'products',
  'vendor_id = current_user_vendor_id()', 
  'Vendor Product Access'
);

-- Customer support sees all orders (via group)
INSERT INTO sys_user_groups VALUES
  ('user-support-1', 'grp-support'),
  ('user-support-2', 'grp-support');

-- Share all orders with support group
UPDATE orders SET secondary_group_id = 'grp-support';

-- Mask payment info from support
INSERT INTO sys_field_permissions VALUES
  ('payment_methods', 'card_number', 'grp-support', 'group', 'read', true),
  ('payment_methods', 'cvv', 'grp-support', 'group', 'none');
```

## Example 6: Enterprise ERP

Complex multi-department, multi-location enterprise system.

### Hierarchical Structure
Copy
```
-- Corporate hierarchy
Company HQ
├── Finance Department
│   ├── Accounting
│   └── Payroll
├── Operations
│   ├── Manufacturing
│   │   ├── Plant A
│   │   └── Plant B
│   └── Distribution
│       ├── Warehouse 1
│       └── Warehouse 2
└── HR Department

-- Branch-based access (record-as-group)
UPDATE sys_table_settings SET
  record_as_group = true,
  record_group_type = 'branch',
  record_group_id_column = 'id',
  record_group_name_column = 'branch_name'
WHERE table_name = 'branches';

-- Employees see data from their branch
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(), 'ws-1', 'inventory',
  'branch_id IN (current_user_branches())', 
  'Branch Access'
);

-- Finance sees all financials
INSERT INTO sys_user_groups VALUES
  ('user-cfo', 'grp-finance');

UPDATE financial_records 
SET primary_group_id = 'grp-finance';

-- Plant managers see only their plant
INSERT INTO sys_record_bindings VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(), 'ws-1', 'production_orders',
  'plant_id = current_user_plant_id()', 
  'Plant-Based Access'
);

# Table Settings

Configure security and behavior settings for each table. Control OWD, RLS, sharing, audit tracking, and advanced record-as-group features.

## sys_table_settings Schema
Copy
```
CREATE TABLE sys_table_settings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id UUID NOT NULL,
  table_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  display_name VARCHAR,
  
  -- Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)
  default_access VARCHAR DEFAULT 'private',
    -- 'public_read_write', 'public_read_only', 'private', 'controlled_by_parent'
  
  -- Parent Table Configuration (for controlled_by_parent)

  record_as_group BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  record_group_type VARCHAR,
  record_group_id_column VARCHAR,
  record_group_name_column VARCHAR,
  
  -- Audit Configuration
  track_created_by BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,

  created_by UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_by UUID,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  UNIQUE(workspace_id, table_name)
);
```

## Key Settings

### default_access

Organization-Wide Default access level (Layer 1)
`public_read_write` - Everyone sees and edits all`public_read_only` - See all, edit yours`private` - See and edit only yours`controlled_by_parent` - Inherit from parent
### rls_enabled

Enable or disable Row-Level Security for this table
Copy
```
true  → Apply all 5 security layers
false → No security (admin-only access)
```

⚠️ Disabling RLS makes table admin-only

### sharing_enabled

Allow records to be shared with users/groups
Copy
```
true  → Layer 4 (shares) active
false → No manual sharing allowed
```

### rls_policies_enabled

Apply custom RLS policies from sys_record_bindings
Copy
```
true  → Layer 5 (RLS policies) active
false → Skip custom policies
```

## Record-as-Group Feature

Advanced feature: Treat each record as a security principal (group). Anyone who has access to the record automatically becomes a "member" of that record-group.

### Use Case: Branch-Based Access
Copy
```
-- Configure branches table as record-as-group
UPDATE sys_table_settings
SET 
  record_as_group = true,
  record_group_type = 'branch',
  record_group_id_column = 'id',
  record_group_name_column = 'branch_name'
WHERE table_name = 'branches';

-- Now each branch record acts as a group!
-- Branch: "San Francisco HQ" (id: branch-sf)
-- Branch: "New York Office" (id: branch-ny)

-- User Alice has access to branch-sf
-- → Alice is automatically in "branch-sf" group
-- → Any record with primary_group_id = 'branch-sf' is accessible to Alice

-- Example: Assign customer to a branch
INSERT INTO customers (id, name, primary_group_id)
VALUES ('cust-123', 'Acme Corp', 'branch-sf');

-- Result: Everyone with access to SF branch can see this customer
```

## Audit Tracking Configuration

#### track_created_by / track_created_at

Automatically populate created_by and created_at on INSERT
Copy
```
INSERT INTO customers (name)
VALUES ('Acme');
-- Automatically adds:
-- created_by = current_user_id()
-- created_at = NOW()
```

#### track_updated_by / track_updated_at

Automatically update updated_by and updated_at on UPDATE
Copy
```
UPDATE customers
SET name = 'Acme Corp';
-- Automatically updates:
-- updated_by = current_user_id()
-- updated_at = NOW()
```

## Configuring Table Settings
Copy
```
-- Create/update table settings
INSERT INTO sys_table_settings (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  table_name,
  display_name,
  default_access,
  rls_enabled,
  sharing_enabled,
  manual_sharing_enabled,
  rls_policies_enabled,
  is_business_entity,
  track_created_by,
  track_updated_by
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'opportunities',
  'Sales Opportunities',
  'private',              -- Private by default
  true,                   -- RLS enabled
  true,                   -- Sharing enabled
  true,                   -- Manual sharing enabled
  true,                   -- RLS policies enabled
  true,                   -- Business entity
  true,                   -- Track who created
  true                    -- Track who updated
)
ON CONFLICT (workspace_id, table_name)
DO UPDATE SET
  default_access = EXCLUDED.default_access,
  rls_enabled = EXCLUDED.rls_enabled,
  sharing_enabled = EXCLUDED.sharing_enabled,
  updated_at = NOW();
```

## Common Configurations

### Customer/Account Tables (CRM)
Copy
```
default_access: 'private'
rls_enabled: true
sharing_enabled: true
manual_sharing_enabled: true
rls_policies_enabled: true
is_business_entity: true
record_as_group: false

→ Secure, shareable, with full RLS
```

### Reference Data Tables
Copy
```
default_access: 'public_read_write'
rls_enabled: false
sharing_enabled: false
manual_sharing_enabled: false
rls_policies_enabled: false
is_business_entity: false

→ Everyone can read/write, no security needed
```

### Branch/Department Tables (Record-as-Group)
Copy
```
default_access: 'private'
rls_enabled: true
sharing_enabled: true
record_as_group: true
record_group_type: 'branch'
record_group_id_column: 'id'
record_group_name_column: 'name'

→ Each record is a group for hierarchical access
```

### Child Records (Controlled by Parent)
Copy
```
default_access: 'controlled_by_parent'
parent_table_name: 'orders'
parent_id_column: 'order_id'
rls_enabled: true
sharing_enabled: false

→ Inherits access from parent orders table
```

Identity Management - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Identity Management

Manage the identities in your system: users, groups, user types, and group types. These form the foundation of your entire security model.

### Users

Individual accounts

### Groups

Organizational units

### User Types

Custom categories

### Group Types

Group categories

## Users

Users are individual accounts in your workspace. Each user has:

### User Properties
FieldTypeDescription`id`UUIDUnique identifier`email`VARCHAREmail address (unique)`name`VARCHARFull name`status`VARCHARactive, inactive, suspended`role`VARCHARworkspace_admin, workspace_user`user_type_id`UUIDLink to user type (optional)
### User Roles

workspace_admin

- • Full workspace access
- • Bypass all RLS policies
- • Manage users and permissions
- • Configure security settings

workspace_user

- • Limited access
- • Subject to RLS policies
- • See only authorized data
- • Cannot manage workspace

## Groups (Hierarchical Organization)

Groups organize users into hierarchical structures (like departments, teams, or organizational units).

### Group Properties
FieldDescription`id`Unique identifier`name`Group name (e.g., "Sales Team")`parent_group_id`Parent group for hierarchy (can be null)`group_type_id`Category (Department, Team, etc.)`kind`Group classification
### Hierarchical Structure Example
Copy
```
Company
├── Sales Department (parent_group_id: null)
│   ├── East Region (parent_group_id: Sales)
│   │   ├── Team A (parent_group_id: East Region)
│   │   └── Team B (parent_group_id: East Region)
│   └── West Region (parent_group_id: Sales)
│       └── Team C (parent_group_id: West Region)
└── Engineering (parent_group_id: null)
    ├── Frontend Team (parent_group_id: Engineering)
    └── Backend Team (parent_group_id: Engineering)

// Users in "Team A" automatically belong to:
// - Team A
// - East Region (parent)
// - Sales Department (grandparent)
```

## User Types

User Types are custom categories for organizing users (similar to Salesforce Record Types).

Employee

Internal staff members

Customer

External customers

Partner

Business partners

Contractor

Temporary contractors

Admin

System administrators

Manager

Department managers

Use user types to apply different security policies, UI layouts, or business logic based on user category.

## Group Types

Group Types categorize groups for better organization and policy application.

Department

Company departments

Team

Project or functional teams

Region

Geographic regions

Division

Business divisions

Office

Physical office locations

Role-Based

Role-specific groups

## Managing Identities

Access identity management from the admin interface:

### Access Control Interface

Navigate to: /{workspaceId}/access-control/identity

Users

CRUD operations, search, filter, pagination, role assignment

Groups

Hierarchical view, drag-drop organization, member management

User Types

Define categories, assign users, manage roles

Group Types

Categorize groups, apply policies

## Principal Concept

A principal is any entity that can have permissions or own data:

### User as Principal

Individual users can:

- • Own records (owner_id)
- • Be assigned permissions
- • Have records shared with them
- • Belong to groups

### Group as Principal

Groups can:

- • Own records (owner_id = group_id)
- • Have records shared with them
- • Grant access to all members
- • Have hierarchical relationships

### Record as Principal

Records can act as groups:

- • Account record = group
- • Related records auto-shared
- • Access inherited
- • Complex hierarchies

**Description:** Role-based access control with workspace admin and workspace user roles, plus custom permission assignment.

---

Roles & Permissions - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Roles & Permissions

Role-based access control system with built-in workspace roles and custom permission assignment.

## Built-In Workspace Roles

Every user in a workspace has one of two roles:

### workspace_admin

Full control

Capabilities:

- • Bypass all RLS: See all data regardless of security layers
- • Manage workspace: Settings, billing, integrations
- • Manage users: Create, edit, delete users and groups
- • Manage security: Configure OWD, RLS policies, permissions
- • Manage tables: Create, modify, delete database tables
- • Manage apps: Create and deploy applications

### workspace_user

Limited access

Capabilities:

- • Subject to RLS: See only authorized data
- • Use apps: Access granted applications
- • View data: Based on permissions and security layers
- • Edit data: Based on permissions and ownership
- • Limited admin: Cannot change security or structure
- • Custom permissions: Can be granted additional access

## User Role Field
Copy
```
-- Users table includes role field
CREATE TABLE sys_users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR,
  
  -- Role assignment
  role VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT 'workspace_user',
    -- 'workspace_admin' or 'workspace_user'
  
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'active',
    -- 'active', 'inactive', 'suspended'
  
  user_type_id UUID,  -- Optional custom user type
  
  -- Metadata
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Check user's role
SELECT role FROM sys_users WHERE id = current_user_id();
```

## Admin Bypass (Layer 0)

Workspace admins automatically bypass all security layers:
Copy
```
-- Security evaluation for ANY query
IF user.role = 'workspace_admin' THEN
  -- Return ALL records (no filtering)
  RETURN query_without_security_filters
ELSE
  -- Apply all 5 security layers
  RETURN query_with_security_filters
END IF

-- Example: Admin query
SELECT * FROM customers;
-- Admin sees: ALL 10,000 customers

-- Example: Regular user query
SELECT * FROM customers;
-- User sees: Only 45 customers they have access to
```

## Permissions System

Beyond roles, users can be granted specific permissions through Permission Sets:

### Table Permissions

CRUD operations on specific tables

- • ps_tbl_{table}_r (read)
- • ps_tbl_{table}_w (write)
- • ps_tbl_{table}_d (delete)

### API Permissions

Access to API endpoints

- • ps_api_{endpoint}_access
- • ps_entities_read
- • ps_entities_write

### Feature Permissions

Access to platform features

- • ps_workflows_create
- • ps_ai_agents_manage
- • ps_portals_admin

## Custom Roles

Create custom roles by combining permission sets:
Copy
```
-- Custom role: "Sales Manager"
-- Stored in sys_roles table
INSERT INTO sys_roles (
  id,
  workspace_id,
  name,
  description,
  permission_sets
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'Sales Manager',
  'Can manage sales data and view reports',
  ARRAY[
    'ps_tbl_accounts_r',
    'ps_tbl_accounts_w',
    'ps_tbl_opportunities_r',
    'ps_tbl_opportunities_w',
    'ps_tbl_reports_r',
    'ps_workflows_create',
    'ps_entities_read'
  ]
);

-- Assign role to user
INSERT INTO sys_user_roles (
  user_id,
  role_id
) VALUES (
  'user-alice',
  'role-sales-manager'
);

-- Alice now has all Sales Manager permissions
```

## Permission Checking

Check if a user has a specific permission:
Copy
```
-- Check if current user has permission
SELECT has_permission('ps_tbl_accounts_w');
-- Returns: true or false

-- Check multiple permissions (requires ALL)
SELECT has_all_permissions(ARRAY[
  'ps_tbl_accounts_r',
  'ps_tbl_accounts_w'
]);

-- Check any permission (requires ANY)
SELECT has_any_permission(ARRAY[
  'ps_workflows_create',
  'ps_workflows_edit'
]);

-- In application code (automatic)
-- User tries to create a workflow
IF !has_permission('ps_workflows_create') THEN
  RETURN 403 Forbidden
END IF
```

## Role Management Interface

## Best Practices

Use workspace_admin sparingly

Only grant admin role to trusted users who need full access

Create role-based groups

Combine custom roles with groups for department-level access

Follow principle of least privilege

Grant only the minimum permissions needed for each role

Use permission sets, not individual permissions

Group related permissions into sets for easier management

Regular access audits

Review user roles and permissions quarterly

**Description:** Protect API endpoints with permission sets and API keys using deterministic UUID-based authorization.

---

API Resource Protection - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# API Resource Protection

Protect API endpoints with permission-based access control. Define which users, roles, or API keys can access specific endpoints.

## API Resource Concept

API Resources are protected endpoints that require specific permissions. Combined with AlgorithmShift's deterministic permission UUID system, you get lightning-fast authorization checks.

### Why Protect API Resources?

While RLS controls data access, API resource protection controls feature access. Example: RLS ensures users only see their customers, but API resource protection determines if they can use the "Export to CSV" API at all.

## sys_api_resources Schema
Copy
```
CREATE TABLE sys_api_resources (
  resource_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id UUID NOT NULL,
  
  -- Resource identification
  resource_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,        -- e.g., "workflows.execute"
  resource_path VARCHAR NOT NULL,        -- e.g., "/api/v1/workflows/:id/execute"
  http_method VARCHAR,                   -- "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "*"
  
  -- Permission requirement
  required_permission_set VARCHAR,       -- e.g., "ps_workflows_execute"
  
  -- Description
  display_name VARCHAR,
  description TEXT,
  category VARCHAR,                      -- "workflows", "ai_agents", "reports"
  
  -- Configuration
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  rate_limit_per_minute INTEGER,
  
  -- Metadata
  created_by UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  UNIQUE(workspace_id, resource_path, http_method)
);
```

## How API Protection Works
Copy
```
// 1. User/API Key makes request
POST /api/v1/workflows/wf-123/execute

// 2. Server checks API resource protection
const resource = await getAPIResource('/api/v1/workflows/:id/execute', 'POST');
// Returns: { required_permission_set: 'ps_workflows_execute' }

// 3. Check if requester has permission (in-memory, instant)
const permissionUUID = getPermissionUUID('ps_workflows_execute');
const hasPermission = user.permissions.includes(permissionUUID);

if (!hasPermission) {
  return 403 Forbidden;
}

// 4. Permission granted, proceed with request
// (RLS still applies to the actual workflow data)
```

## Common API Resources

### Workflow Execution
Copy
```
INSERT INTO sys_api_resources (
  resource_id,
  workspace_id,
  resource_name,
  resource_path,
  http_method,
  required_permission_set,
  display_name,
  category
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'workflows.execute',
  '/api/v1/workflows/:id/execute',
  'POST',
  'ps_workflows_execute',
  'Execute Workflow',
  'workflows'
);

-- Now only users with ps_workflows_execute can trigger workflows
```

### Data Export
Copy
```
INSERT INTO sys_api_resources (
  resource_id,
  workspace_id,
  resource_name,
  resource_path,
  http_method,
  required_permission_set,
  display_name
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'data.export',
  '/api/v1/tables/:table/export',
  'POST',
  'ps_data_export',
  'Export Data to CSV/Excel'
);

-- Requires ps_data_export permission to use export API
```

### AI Agent Management
Copy
```
INSERT INTO sys_api_resources VALUES
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'workspace-123', 'agents.create',
   '/api/v1/agents', 'POST', 'ps_ai_agents_create', 'Create AI Agent', 'ai_agents'),
  
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'workspace-123', 'agents.update',
   '/api/v1/agents/:id', 'PUT', 'ps_ai_agents_manage', 'Update AI Agent', 'ai_agents'),
  
  (gen_random_uuid(), 'workspace-123', 'agents.delete',
   '/api/v1/agents/:id', 'DELETE', 'ps_ai_agents_manage', 'Delete AI Agent', 'ai_agents');

-- Different permissions for create vs manage
```

## API Keys with Permission Sets

API keys can be created with specific permission sets, allowing external systems to access protected resources:
Copy
```
-- Create API key with specific permissions
INSERT INTO sys_api_keys (
  api_key_id,
  workspace_id,
  key_name,
  key_hash,
  permission_sets,  -- Array of permission set names
  user_id,
  expires_at
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'workspace-123',
  'Zapier Integration Key',
  hash('ask_live_...'),
  ARRAY[
    'ps_workflows_execute',
    'ps_tbl_customers_r',
    'ps_tbl_customers_w',
    'ps_webhooks_receive'
  ],
  'user-alice',
  NOW() + INTERVAL '90 days'
);

-- When API key is used:
-- 1. Convert permission set names → UUIDs
-- 2. Check if required permission UUID is in key's permission UUIDs
-- 3. Grant or deny access
```

## Permission Checking Middleware
Copy
```
// Express middleware example
async function requirePermission(permissionName: string) {
  return async (req, res, next) => {
    // Get user or API key from request
    const principal = req.user || req.apiKey;
    
    if (!principal) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
    }
    
    // Check permission (in-memory, instant)
    const permissionUUID = getPermissionUUID(permissionName);
    const hasPermission = principal.permissions.includes(permissionUUID);
    
    if (!hasPermission) {
      return res.status(403).json({ 
        error: 'Forbidden',
        required_permission: permissionName 
      });
    }
    
    next();
  };
}

// Usage
app.post('/api/v1/workflows/:id/execute',
  requirePermission('ps_workflows_execute'),
  async (req, res) => {
    // Execute workflow
  }
);
```

## Resource Categories
CategoryExample ResourcesPermission SetsWorkflowsExecute, Create, Delete`ps_workflows_*`AI AgentsCreate, Manage, Chat`ps_ai_agents_*`DataExport, Import, Bulk Edit`ps_data_*`ReportsCreate, Run, Export`ps_reports_*`PortalsCreate, Configure, Deploy`ps_portals_*`FunctionsDeploy, Execute, Monitor`ps_functions_*`StorageUpload, Download, Delete`ps_storage_*`
## Rate Limiting by Resource
Copy
```
-- Set rate limits per resource
UPDATE sys_api_resources
SET rate_limit_per_minute = 10
WHERE resource_name = 'workflows.execute';

UPDATE sys_api_resources
SET rate_limit_per_minute = 100
WHERE resource_name = 'data.query';

-- Expensive operations: Lower limits
-- Read operations: Higher limits

**Description:** Best practices for implementing and maintaining secure data authorization in AlgorithmShift.

Security Best Practices - AlgorithmShift Documentation | AlgorithmShiftDocumentationData Authorization & Security
# Security Best Practices

Essential guidelines for implementing and maintaining secure data authorization in your AlgorithmShift workspace.

## Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)

### ✓ Start with Private, Open as Needed

Set default_access to 'private' for sensitive tables, then grant access through groups and shares.
Copy
```
-- Good: Secure by default
default_access: 'private'
-- Then explicitly grant access via groups

-- Bad: Too open
default_access: 'public_read_write'  ❌
```

### ✓ Use Public Read for Reference Data

Tables like countries, states, categories can be public_read_only or public_read_write.

### ✓ Use Controlled by Parent for Child Records

Order line items, contact notes, account attachments should inherit parent access.

## Groups & Hierarchies

### ✓ Mirror Your Organization Structure

Create groups that match your real-world departments, teams, and regions.
Copy
```
Company
├── Sales
│   ├── North America
│   └── Europe
├── Engineering
│   ├── Frontend
│   └── Backend
└── Support
```

### ✓ Use primary_group_id for Main Team

Assign records to the primary responsible team via primary_group_id.

### ✓ Use secondary_group_id for Cross-Functional

Use secondary_group_id for project teams, temporary collaborators, or secondary ownership.

### ✗ Don't Create Too Many Nested Levels

Keep hierarchy depth under 5 levels for performance. More than 5 levels can slow queries.

## RLS Policies

### ✓ Keep Policies Simple

Complex RLS policies impact query performance. Keep conditions simple and well-indexed.
Copy
```
-- Good: Simple, indexed
region = current_user_region()

-- Bad: Complex, unindexed
LOWER(region) LIKE LOWER(current_user_region() || '%')  ❌
```

### ✓ Index Fields Used in RLS
Copy
```
-- Create indexes for RLS policy fields
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_region ON customers(region);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_leads_assigned_to ON leads(assigned_to);
```

### ✓ Test RLS Policies Thoroughly

Test with multiple user accounts to ensure policies work as expected and don't over-restrict.

### ✗ Don't Use RLS for Business Logic

RLS is for security, not business rules. Use application logic or database triggers for business rules.

## Roles & Permissions

### ✓ Follow Principle of Least Privilege

Grant only the minimum permissions needed for users to do their job.

### ✓ Use Roles, Not Individual Permissions

Create roles (Sales Rep, Support Agent) and assign roles, not individual permissions.

### ✓ Grant workspace_admin Sparingly

Admin role bypasses ALL security. Only grant to fully trusted users.

### ✓ Regular Access Reviews

Quarterly review of who has what permissions. Remove access no longer needed.

## Field-Level Security

### ✓ Hide PII from Regular Users
Copy
```
-- Hide sensitive fields
access_level: 'none' for SSN, DOB, Tax ID
```

### ✓ Mask Financial Data
Copy
```
-- Mask instead of hide when UI needs field
access_level: 'read', mask_value: true
-- Shows: ****-****-****-1234
```

### ✓ Make Audit Fields Read-Only

created_at, created_by, updated_at, updated_by should be read-only for all users.

## Sharing & Collaboration

### ✓ Share with Groups, Not Users

Sharing with groups is more maintainable as team membership changes.

### ✓ Use Appropriate Access Levels

- • read - For visibility only
- • read_write - For collaboration
- • manage - Rarely needed (like ownership)

### ✗ Don't Over-Share

Excessive manual shares make security hard to audit. Use groups and OWD instead when possible.

## Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes
Copy
```
CREATE INDEX idx_owner ON customers(owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_primary_group ON customers(primary_group_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_secondary_group ON customers(secondary_group_id);
```

### Session Caching

- • Cache user groups in session
- • Cache permissions in JWT
- • Cache table settings in app

## Security Checklist
All sensitive tables set to private OWDGroups mirror organizational structureRLS policies are simple and indexedAdmin role granted to < 5% of usersPII fields have field-level securityAudit logging enabled on all tablesRegular access reviews (quarterly)API keys have expiration datesPermission sets follow least privilegeTest security with non-admin accounts
