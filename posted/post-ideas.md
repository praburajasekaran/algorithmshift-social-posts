Prabu — here are **three high-energy, top-of-funnel social post ideas** focused on the “no-code / low-code” (NC/LC) enterprise theme, each firmly rooted in recent news/trends — and crafted to encourage shares, saves and conversation. You can tweak tone or visuals to fit your brand voice.

### 1. “Why 84% of Tech Leaders Are *Still Betting on Low-Code”

**Hook:** 🚀 *“Think AI will make low-code obsolete? Think again.”*
**Core content:**

* According to the 2025 report by App Builder, **84% of tech leaders say AI will *not* replace low-code/no-code tools** — instead, 76% believe AI will *enhance* them. ([Visual Studio Magazine][1])
* For enterprises, this signals: NC/LC is not a novelty, it’s becoming the backbone of enterprise app delivery.
* Ask: *“If your org is investing in AI, are you also doubling down on your low-/no-code capability?”*
  **CTA prompt:** “Tag a CIO/VP IT who STILL thinks low-code is fringe. Let’s get the myth busting started.”
  **Visual idea:** A bold stat graphic: “84% of tech leaders won’t give up low-code” + half the image crosses out the “AI kills devs” myth.
  **Why it can go viral:** It challenges a popular assumption (that AI replaces everything). It gives a clear stat. It invites tagging. It opens a thread of debate.

### 2. “From SaaS-Sprawl to DIY Apps: The Low-Code Pivot Every CIO Must Know”

**Hook:** 🔧 *“When you have 100–300 SaaS apps, maybe you should build instead of buy.”*
**Core content:**

* Recent coverage (via Computer Weekly) highlights that many enterprises face “SaaS sprawl” (100–300+ applications) and are turning to low-code/AI to *build custom apps* rather than continuously buying new ones. ([Computer Weekly][2])
* Key message: Low-code unlocks the “build vs buy” switch — empowering internal teams, reducing silos, consolidating the tech stack.
* For marketing/ops/IT consultants (like your role), this is a huge opportunity: advise clients to shift from licence-churn to capability-creation.
  **CTA prompt:** “What’s your org’s top 3 SaaS apps? Could you build them inhouse instead of buying version 2 next year? #LowCodeRevolution”
  **Visual idea:** Two side-by-side panels: Left = “300 SaaS tools”, Right = “>50 internal apps built w/ low-code” (or a mock-up of build).
  **Why it can go viral:** It taps into a pain point (tool overload), gives a provocative “build vs buy” lens, invites self-reflection (which drives shares).

### 3. “C-Suite: Low-Code Isn’t About DIY — It’s Your Strategic Weapon”

**Hook:** 👔 *“75% of C-Suite execs now see low-code as the *only* future way to code.”*
**Core content:**

* According to Mendix research, 75% of senior execs believe low-code is the only option for coding in future enterprise apps. ([Mendix][3])
* Plus: 53% rank digital transformation as their leading low-code use case.
* Implication: Low-code is no longer just a tool for “citizen devs” — it’s board-room strategic.
* For your marketing consultant voice: You can own the story that low-code unlocks “fusion teams” (business + IT) and accelerates innovation across the enterprise.
  **CTA prompt:** “C-Suite / VP Tech: if you’re not asking your org how many apps you’ll deliver via low-code this year — you might be behind. #DigitalTransformation #LowCode”
  **Visual idea:** Infographic stylised as “C-Suite mindset shift” with stat call-outs and icons for CIO/CEO/COO adoption.
  **Why it can go viral:** It speaks directly to decision-makers and influencers, frames low-code as a strategic shift (not just another tool), and invites senior professionals to weigh in.

4. The "Future of Work" Thought Leadership Post
This post will connect the low-code trend to the broader conversation about AI and the future of work, positioning your brand as a forward-thinking leader.

Hook: Your next developer might not be a developer at all.

Post Body:

Start with a bold statement: Gartner predicts that by 2025, over 70% of new enterprise applications will be built using low-code or no-code technologies.​

Explain the impact: This isn't just about making developers faster. It's about empowering business users—the people who know the problems best—to build their own solutions. This is the rise of the "citizen developer".​

Connect to AI: Now, with the integration of generative AI, this trend is accelerating. Imagine describing a business need in plain English and watching an AI agent build the application for you. According to Mendix's Chief Product Officer, this is the future of software engineering.​

Pose a question to the audience: How would your business change if anyone could build the tools they need to be more effective?

Call to Action: The future of work is being built on low-code. Are you ready?

Hashtags: #FutureOfWork #AI #CitizenDeveloper #LowCode #Innovation #BusinessTransformation



### Bonus tip on making the posts **shareable / viral**:

* Use **bold, clear stats** (people love quoting them).
* Pose a **question** or challenge — that boosts comments.
* Tag roles rather than individuals (e.g., “Tag a CIO”, “Share if you’re in digital transformation”).
* Use **carousels** or image-based posts (stat + myth + call-out).
* Consider adding a **“story” or “poll”** follow-up: e.g., “Does your org already use low-code? ✅/❌ – tell us how many apps you built”
* Use hashtags targeted at enterprise+no-code: #LowCode #NoCode #EnterpriseAutomation #DigitalTransformation #CitizenDeveloper
