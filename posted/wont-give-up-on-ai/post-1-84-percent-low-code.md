🚀 **Think AI will make low-code obsolete? Think again.**

According to the 2025 App Builder Report, **84% of tech leaders say AI will NOT replace low-code/no-code tools** — instead, 76% believe AI will *enhance* them.

Here's what this means for enterprise organizations:

🔹 Low-code is not a passing trend — it's becoming the backbone of enterprise app delivery
🔹 AI and low-code are *complementary*, not competitive
🔹 The future belongs to organizations that embrace both technologies

**The question for tech leaders:**
If your organization is investing in AI, are you also doubling down on your low-code capability?
