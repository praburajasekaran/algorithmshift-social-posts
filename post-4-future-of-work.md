💡 **Your next developer might not be a developer at all.**

Gartner predicts that by 2025, **over 70% of new enterprise applications will be built using low-code or no-code technologies.**

This isn't just about making developers faster. This is about fundamentally transforming WHO can build software.

**Welcome to the era of the "Citizen Developer."**

**Here's what's happening:**

The people who understand business problems best — your operations managers, business analysts, marketers, and department leads — can now build their own solutions.

No computer science degree required.
No syntax to memorize.
No deployment pipelines to configure.

Just drag, drop, connect, and deploy.

**And now, with generative AI integration, this is accelerating even faster.**

According to Mendix's Chief Product Officer, we're approaching a future where you describe a business need in plain English, and an AI agent builds the application for you.

**Think about the implications:**

🔹 **Speed:** From idea to working application in days, not months
🔹 **Relevance:** Solutions built by people who actually use them
🔹 **Scalability:** Thousands of micro-applications solving specific pain points
🔹 **Innovation:** Ideas that would never make it to an IT backlog can now become reality

**The question that should be on every leader's mind:**

*"How would our business change if anyone could build the tools they need to be more effective?"*

At AlgorithmShift, we're building exactly this future — an enterprise platform where business users and professional developers work side-by-side, each empowered to contribute at their skill level.

**This is the democratization of software creation.**

And it's not coming. It's here.

**70% of new apps will be built with LOW-CODE by 2025.** — Gartner

Let that sink in. ↓

**The future:**

❌ "We need to hire more developers"
✅ "Our team can build what we need"

❌ "Submit a ticket and wait 6 months"  
✅ "Build it yourself this week"

❌ Computer science degree required
✅ Plain English → Working app

**This is the CITIZEN DEVELOPER revolution.** 🚀

Business analysts.
Marketing managers.
Operations leads.
Product owners.

They're all becoming builders. 💪

**With AI + Low-Code:**
- Describe what you need in plain English
- AI helps build it
- You launch it
- Your team uses it

**The game-changer question:**

What would YOU build if you could build anything?

Innovation isn't limited by coding skills anymore.
It's limited only by imagination. ✨

The future of work is being built on low-code.
Are you ready to be a creator?

🚀 **Imagine if anyone on your team could build the software they need...**

Sounds crazy, right?

But it's already happening.

**The stat:** By 2025, 70% of new enterprise apps will be built using low-code or no-code tools (according to Gartner).

**What does that mean in real terms?**

Your marketing manager can build a custom campaign tracker.
Your operations lead can build a workflow automation tool.
Your sales team can build their perfect CRM features.

No coding required. Just drag, drop, and deploy.

**This is what they call "Citizen Developers"** — regular business people who can now build professional applications without writing a single line of code.

**Add AI to the mix?** 🤖

Now you can literally describe what you want in plain English, and AI helps build it for you. It's like having a software developer in your pocket.

**The big question:**

*"How would your business change if anyone could build the tools they need to be more effective?"*

More innovation. Faster problem-solving. Less waiting on IT. More empowerment.

At AlgorithmShift, we're making this vision a reality for enterprise organizations. The future of work isn't about hiring more developers — it's about empowering everyone to BE a developer.

**The future is here.** And anyone can build it.
