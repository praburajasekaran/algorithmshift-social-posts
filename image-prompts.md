## Post 1: "Why 84% of Tech Leaders Are Still Betting on Low-Code"

### Primary Image Prompt (1080x1080 - Instagram/LinkedIn Square)

```
Create a modern, professional infographic-style image with a clean, minimal design. The background should feature a sophisticated gradient from deep charcoal (#1a1a1a) on the left transitioning to rich teal (#11715b) on the right. 

In the center, display a large, bold "84%" in white, ultra-modern sans-serif font (like Helvetica Neue or Inter Bold), size approximately 200pt. The percentage should have a subtle glow effect in the brand teal color (#11715b).

Below the 84%, add the text "of tech leaders WON'T give up low-code" in white, clean sans-serif, size 32pt, with high contrast.

On the left side of the image, create a crossed-out myth text that reads "AI KILLS DEVS" in red (#ff4444) with a bold diagonal red line crossing through it. The crossed-out text should look like a debunked myth.

On the right side, add small AI-related icons (neural network nodes, circuit patterns) in subtle teal (#11715b) and light gray (#e0e0e0), creating a tech-forward aesthetic without overwhelming the main statistic.

At the bottom, add a thin horizontal line in teal (#11715b) with small text "Source: 2025 App Builder Report" in light gray (#cccccc), size 14pt.

In the bottom right corner, place "AlgorithmShift.ai" in white, modern font, size 18pt, with a small geometric logo mark (abstract cube or shift icon) in the brand teal color.

Style: Clean, corporate, data-driven, modern tech aesthetic. High contrast. Professional. Emphasize the 84% stat as the hero element. Use plenty of white space. Subtle shadows and depth to create visual hierarchy.
```

### Twitter/X Variant (1600x900 - Landscape)

```
Create a wide-format version optimized for Twitter/X feed at 1600x900px. Maintain the same gradient background flowing horizontally from charcoal (#1a1a1a) on the left through brand teal (#11715b) in the center to darker teal on the right.

LEFT THIRD (533px):
Display the hero stat "84%" in massive white bold text, size 220pt, with a subtle teal glow effect (#11715b).
Below: "OF TECH LEADERS" in white, size 32pt, bold.
Add small upward trend arrow icon in teal below the text.
Background: Circuit board pattern in very low opacity (10%) in gray.

CENTER THIRD (533px):
Create a large red badge with diagonal warning stripes containing:
"MYTH:" in white, size 28pt, above
"AI KILLS DEVS" in white, size 44pt, bold
Bold red X (size 180pt) crossing through the entire text diagonally.
Add small "DEBUNKED" stamp in red at the bottom of the badge.

RIGHT THIRD (534px):
Create a bright teal badge (#11715b) with subtle glow:
"TRUTH:" in white, size 28pt, above
"AI ENHANCES" in white, size 44pt, bold
"LOW-CODE" in white, size 44pt, bold (second line)
Large white checkmark icon (✓) in the top-right of the badge.
Add small "2025 DATA" label below in white, size 16pt.

Add subtle tech elements throughout: neural network nodes, connecting lines, and geometric shapes in teal and white at 15% opacity to fill the horizontal space without cluttering.

BOTTOM BAR:
Create a dark semi-transparent bar (30% opacity black) across the full width at the bottom (80px height):
Left side: "Source: 2025 App Builder Report" in light gray, size 18pt
Right side: "AlgorithmShift.ai | Enterprise Low-Code Platform" in white, size 20pt

Style: High contrast, Twitter-optimized design. Bold, clear messaging for fast scrolling. Professional but attention-grabbing. Larger canvas allows for more breathing room and bigger text. Optimized for both desktop and mobile Twitter viewing.
```

### Instagram Feed Vertical (1080x1350 - 4:5 Portrait)

```
Create a vertical portrait format optimized for Instagram feed scrolling. Use a sophisticated gradient background flowing from top to bottom: start with deep charcoal (#1a1a1a) at the top 25%, transitioning through the brand teal (#11715b) in the middle 50%, and ending with a darker teal (#0d5545) at the bottom 25%.

TOP SECTION (First 25%):
Display the headline "THINK AI WILL MAKE LOW-CODE OBSOLETE?" in white, bold, size 38pt, centered, with line breaks for readability. Add a thinking face emoji (🤔) above the text.

MIDDLE SECTION (Middle 50% - Hero Area):
Create a large circular badge/seal design centered in this section:
- Outer circle: Teal border (#11715b), 4px thick, diameter 450px
- Inner fill: Semi-transparent dark background (#1a1a1a at 80% opacity)
- Inside the circle, display the hero stat "84%" in massive white bold text, size 180pt
- Below the percentage, add "OF TECH LEADERS" in white, size 24pt
- Below that, add "won't give up low-code" in white, size 28pt, medium weight

Around the circle (orbital style), place 4-5 small icons representing:
- AI neural network (top right, in bright teal)
- Code brackets (right, in white)  
- Upward trend arrow (bottom right, in bright teal)
- Team collaboration icon (left, in white)
- Lightbulb innovation icon (top left, in bright teal)

These icons should be small (40px each) and connected to the circle with thin dotted lines in teal, creating a sense of interconnection.

LOWER SECTION (Bottom 25%):
On the left side, create a red badge with diagonal stripes containing the crossed-out text "MYTH: AI KILLS DEVS" in white with a bold red X through it.

On the right side, create a green/teal badge with text "TRUTH: AI ENHANCES LOW-CODE" in white with a checkmark icon.

At the very bottom, add a thin white line separator, then place:
- "Source: 2025 App Builder Report" in light gray, size 14pt, centered
- Below that: "AlgorithmShift.ai" in white with the tagline "Enterprise Low-Code Platform" in teal, size 16pt

Add subtle geometric patterns (dots, thin lines, hexagons) in the background in very low opacity (10-15%) throughout the teal sections to add visual interest without overwhelming.

Style: Modern, mobile-optimized, scroll-stopping design. High contrast for small screens. Clear visual hierarchy flowing top to bottom. The circular hero element should be the immediate eye-catcher. Professional but engaging. Clean typography. Use depth and shadows to create layers. Optimized for thumb-scrolling users.

- Each figure should be stylized and minimal (stick-figure evolution, modern line art)
- Size: approximately 200px tall each

Above and around each figure, display floating UI building blocks in white outlines with teal accents:
- Drag-and-drop block icons (like puzzle pieces)
- Flowchart decision diamonds
- Form builder grids
- Dashboard/chart widgets
- Mobile phone mockups
- Database cylinder icons
- API connection nodes

These elements should appear to be "in use" by the figures - connected with thin glowing teal lines (2px) from figures' "hands" to the UI elements, suggesting active creation and manipulation.

On the LEFT side, create a vertical glowing badge with teal background (#11715b):
"70%" in huge white text (72pt)

- Flowchart diamonds
- Form builder grids
- Dashboard widgets
- Mobile app mockups
- Database icons
- API nodes

Connect figures to UI elements with thin glowing teal lines (2px), showing active creation.

Add 30-40 particle effects: small glowing dots (4-6px) in teal and white creating energy trails and connections between elements.

RIGHT SECTION (500px):
Top: "THE FUTURE" header in white, size 32pt, bold, letter-spaced.

Create a word cloud arrangement in white and teal text, varying sizes:
"CITIZEN DEVELOPER" - largest, bright teal, 36pt

Style: Futuristic, inspiring, and highly engaging. Balance tech aesthetics with human empowerment. Use glowing effects, particles, and dynamic composition. Modern, hopeful palette. Clear left-to-right narrative: hook → vision → impact. Twitter-optimized for fast comprehension. Should stop mid-scroll with aspirational message. Professional but accessible. Inspire viewers to see themselves as potential creators. Dynamic energy and positive transformation.
```

### Instagram Stories Interactive Variant (1080x1920 - Vertical)

```
Create a vertical, immersive version. Top 30%: Display the main headline "YOUR NEXT DEVELOPER might not be a developer at all" with more dramatic sizing. Middle 50%: Larger holographic figures with more floating UI elements, creating an immersive tunnel effect drawing the eye down. Add animated-style motion lines in teal. Bottom 20%: Add a poll sticker area with question "Does your team use low-code?" with Yes/No options. Make the background gradient more dramatic in vertical format. Add more particle effects for visual interest. Include "Swipe up to learn more" at the very bottom.
