🏗️ **One database schema. Three different frontends. Zero duplication.**

Here's the reality most teams face: You build a web app, then need a mobile app, then need workflow automations. Each one requires separate development, separate APIs, separate maintenance.

**What if you could build once and deploy everywhere?**

**The Unified Platform Approach:**

📊 **One Schema:** Single PostgreSQL database with unified data model
🔌 **Auto-Generated APIs:** REST and GraphQL endpoints for every table
🌐 **Web Apps:** React/Next.js with SEO optimization and PWA support
📱 **Native Mobile:** React Native apps for iOS and Android
⚙️ **Workflows:** Visual automation builder with code access

**The Architecture:**

**Data Layer (Center):**
- Unified PostgreSQL database
- Auto-generated REST APIs
- Auto-generated GraphQL APIs
- Role-based access control
- Row-level security

**Frontend Layer (Three Outputs):**

1. **Web Applications:**
   - React/Next.js framework
   - Responsive design
   - SEO optimized
   - PWA ready
   - Shared authentication

2. **Mobile Applications:**
   - React Native + Expo
   - Native iOS and Android
   - Real-time sync
   - Push notifications
   - Offline-first capability

3. **Workflow Automations:**
   - Visual node-based builder
   - Database triggers
   - API integrations
   - Scheduled tasks
   - Event-driven workflows

**The Strategic Benefits:**

✅ **Single Source of Truth:** One schema, one data model, one source
✅ **Shared Authentication:** Users, roles, permissions across all surfaces
✅ **Real-time Sync:** Changes in one frontend reflect everywhere
✅ **Theming Parity:** Consistent design system across web, mobile, workflows
✅ **Reusable Components:** Build once, use everywhere
✅ **Faster Development:** No duplicate API development
✅ **Easier Maintenance:** Update schema once, all frontends benefit

**The Business Impact:**

Instead of:
- 3 separate development teams
- 3 separate API projects
- 3 separate maintenance cycles
- 3 separate deployment pipelines

You get:
- 1 unified platform
- 1 shared data model
- 1 development team
- 1 deployment process

**Real-world scenario:**

Build a customer portal (web), add a mobile app for field teams, then automate order processing workflows — all from the same database schema, all sharing the same authentication, all syncing in real-time.

At AlgorithmShift, we've built our platform around this unified architecture: One schema powers every experience.

Build once. Ship everywhere. 🚀

**ONE SCHEMA. THREE SURFACES.**

Web • Mobile • Workflows

**THE PROBLEM:**
❌ Separate APIs for each
❌ Duplicate development
❌ Different auth systems
❌ Sync nightmares
❌ 3x the maintenance

**THE SOLUTION:**
✅ One unified database
✅ Auto REST + GraphQL
✅ Shared authentication
✅ Real-time sync
✅ Build once, deploy 3x

**HOW IT WORKS:**

📊 Data Layer (Center)
→ Unified PostgreSQL
→ Auto-generated APIs
→ Shared auth

🌐 Web Apps
→ React/Next.js
→ SEO optimized
→ PWA ready

📱 Mobile Apps
→ React Native
→ Native iOS/Android
→ Real-time sync

⚙️ Workflows
→ Visual builder
→ Database triggers
→ API integrations

**THE BENEFIT:**

Instead of building 3 separate systems...
You build 1 platform that powers everything.

**ONE PLATFORM. INFINITE POSSIBILITIES.** 💪

💡 **Here's a question for developers and business owners: What if you could build your web app, mobile app, and workflow automations all from the same database?**

Most teams build these separately:
- Web app with its own API
- Mobile app with its own API
- Workflow automations with separate integrations

That means 3x the development, 3x the maintenance, and 3x the headaches.

**The Unified Platform Approach:**

Instead of building three separate systems, you build ONE platform that powers everything:

**One Database Schema:**
- Single PostgreSQL database
- Unified data model
- One source of truth

**Auto-Generated APIs:**
- REST endpoints for every table
- GraphQL for flexible queries
- No manual API development needed

**Three Frontends:**

1. **Web Apps:** React/Next.js, SEO optimized, PWA ready
2. **Mobile Apps:** React Native, native iOS and Android, real-time sync
3. **Workflows:** Visual automation builder, database triggers, API integrations

**The Benefits:**

✅ Build once, deploy everywhere
✅ Shared authentication across all surfaces
✅ Real-time sync between web, mobile, and workflows
✅ Consistent theming and design system
✅ Reusable components
✅ Faster development cycles
✅ Easier maintenance

**Think about it:**

You build a customer portal for your website, then add a mobile app for your field team, then automate order processing workflows — all from the same database, all sharing the same users and permissions, all syncing in real-time.

**That's the power of unified architecture.**

At AlgorithmShift, we've built our platform around this concept: One schema powers every experience.
